<p>
Rocks v4.1 is released for i386, x86_64 and ia64 CPU architectures.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avalanche Installer</li>
<p>
The Avalanche Installer uses a BitTorrent tracker to support highly-scalable concurrent compute node installation.</p>
<p>
For example, let's say compute node A and compute node B are installing. If compute node A has already downloaded a package that compute node B needs, then compute node B will retrieve the package from compute node A, not from the frontend.</p>
<p>
The Avalanche Installer drastically reduces the pressure on the frontend when many compute nodes are concurrently installed.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<li>Creation of the "Rocks Foundation Class"</li>
<p>
We've started moving "critical" tools (e.g., python and MySQL) under /opt/rocks.</p>
<p>
The idea is to protect the tools that Rocks relies upon from updates that are applied by automated OS update programs (e.g., up2date and yum).</p>
<li>New blog-based frontend homepage</li>
<p>
The default frontend homepage is now based on WordPress.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>OS Roll based on CentOS release 4/update 2 and all updates as of October 18 2005</li>
<li>Updated SGE roll to SGE 6 update 6</li>
<li>"rocks-mirror" modified to build Roll CD sets for any RPM repository</li>
<li>For example, you could direct "rocks-mirror" at the BU Linux repository and it will produce 4 ISOs that are compatible with Rocks.</li>
<li>Updated MyPhpAdmin to address security issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for partitioning, especially in NAS and Compute appliances with multiple controllers</li>
<li>Removal of ganglia metrics that cause SCSI error on Adaptec, 3Ware, and other controllers</li>
<li>Fix to allow backtick (`) in root password</li>
<li>Support for multi-level device naming of Compaq (CCISS) and other RAID controllers</li>
<li>Support for per-cluster, per-appliance, and per-node static routing definitions</li>
<li>ATLAS/HPL now runs on EM64T machines in 64-bit mode.</li>
</ul>
