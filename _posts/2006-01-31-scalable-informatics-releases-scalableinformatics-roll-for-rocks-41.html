<p><i>Joe Landman at Scalable Informatics announces:</i></p>
<p>We created a roll to include some tools we have found useful, and one we have written.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>pdsh</b> - parallel distributed shell.  Sort of like cluster-fork, but much faster (and ctrl-c works)</li>
<li><b>whatsup</b> - sort of like ganglia --alive, but it works quickly ...</li>
<li><b>ctop</b> - a cluster top from the command line.  Early access, a few bugs, but our customers like it so far</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Feel free to pull the roll from <a href="http://downloads.scalableinformatics.com/downloads/rocks/rolls/ScalableInformatics-4.1.0-1.x86_64.disk1.iso">here</a>.</p>
<h3>License</h3></p>
<p>The pdsh and whatsup are GPLv2, ctop is GPL v2 for non-commercial/non-supported projects, and commercially licensed for others.</p>
