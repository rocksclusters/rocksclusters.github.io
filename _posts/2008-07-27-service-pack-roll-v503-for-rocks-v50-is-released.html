<p>The Service Pack Roll v5.0.3 for i386 and x86_64 architectures is released.</p>
<p>This roll includes the following new fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Roll - Fix for Dell Virtual Floppy. On Dell machines that have Dell Remote Access Controllers (DRACs), the Dell Virtual Floppy would be recognized by anaconda as a hard disk. This would cause an exception that looks like:
<p>Traceback (most recent call first):<br />
  File "/tmp/product/autopart.py", line 1230, in doAutoPartition<br />
    for f in initial_free[drive]:<br />
  File "/usr/lib/anaconda/dispatch.py", line 201, in moveStep<br />
    rc = stepFunc(self.anaconda)<br />
  File "/usr/lib/anaconda/dispatch.py", line 124, in gotoNext<br />
    self.moveStep()<br />
  File "/usr/lib/anaconda/dispatch.py", line 223, in currentStep<br />
    self.gotoNext()<br />
  File "/usr/lib/anaconda/iw/release_notes.py", line 86, in resize<br />
    (step, args) = self.anaconda.dispatch.currentStep()<br />
  File "/usr/lib/anaconda/iw/release_notes.py", line 51, in __init__<br />
    self.resize()<br />
  File "/tmp/product/gui.py", line 1148, in __init__<br />
    self.rnv = ReleaseNotesViewer(self.anaconda)<br />
  File "/tmp/product/gui.py", line 977, in run<br />
    self.icw = InstallControlWindow (self.anaconda)<br />
  File "/usr/bin/anaconda", line 982, in ?<br />
    anaconda.intf.run(anaconda)<br />
KeyError: 'sdb'</p>
<p>The fix is to filter out hard disks that don't have 'media present' (which is how the Dell Virtual Floppy behaves). </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this Service Pack Roll includes all the fixes from the previous Service Pack Rolls.</p>
<p>This Service Pack Roll can be installed over an existing Service Pack Roll, that is, there is no need to remove a previous Service Pack Roll before installing this one.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of all the fixes can be found <a href="http://www.rocksclusters.org/roll-documentation/service-pack/5.0.3/fixes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This roll can be installed onto a running frontend.</p>
