<p>Rocks v4.2.1 is released for the ia64 CPU architecture.</p>
<p>The Rocks Development Group at UCSD would like to thank Roy Dragseth from the HPC Group at the University of Tromso for his help during the final testing phase. He executed the loop of "install, test, reported bugs, repeat" until we got it right.</p>
