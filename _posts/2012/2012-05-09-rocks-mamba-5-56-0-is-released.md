The latest update of Rocks codename Mamba is now released. Mamba is available
for both CentOS 5.8 (Rocks 5.5) and CentOS 6.2 (Rocks 6.0).  The
Rocks-supplied OS rolls have all updates applied as of May 7, 2012.

Rolls use the same code base but are compiled on the different version of
Operating Systems.  
Please see the [Downloads Page][1] to get started. Mamba is available for both
32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  [Release notes][2] are available.

Many thanks for all those who beta-tested this version of Rocks.
