Rocks-A-Palooza IV (Rocks All Hands Meeting)<br />
Atkinson Hall (CalIT2), UCSD<br />
La Jolla, CA</p>
<p>Rocks-a-Palooza IV will be held at Atkinson Hall on the campus of UCSD in La Jolla on May 13th and 14th 2009.</p>
<p>There will be one main session focused on Rocks internals. Participants will leave with an understanding on how to tune Rocks to fit their specific requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a poster session where Rocks community members can share their creativity and cleverness.</p>
<p>The preliminary agenda can be found <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pzJ8Gv7V6n_4SI_NzinV3Mg">here</a>.</p>
<p>Attendance is free for participants from non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Since this meeting is supported by the NSF, attendees from for-profit entities can attend, but they must become sponsors of the event. The minimum sponsorship is $1,000 which includes two passes to the event. Additional passes cost $500 each.</p>
<p>We encourage all to attend to learn the latest in Rocks and to meet users and developers from the Rocks community.</p>
<p>Registration is limited to 100 and registration will be closed on May 1st (to allow us to accurately budget for meals, snacks and other costs).</p>
<p>To register or to enter a poster, send your request to:</p>
<p> rap@rocksclusters.org</p>
