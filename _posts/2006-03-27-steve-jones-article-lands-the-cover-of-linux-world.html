<p><i>Steve Jones from Stanford University says:</i></p>
<p>"Success in High Performance Computing is synonymous with using Rocks Clusters. I've been successful in building many clusters over the years and am able to effectively manage a huge amount of systems entirely based on using Rocks."</p>

<p>OK, so I drink the kool-aid... but I also write about it. The latest article made the front page of Linux World (March), "Rapid Cluster Deployment: From delivery to Production in Hours". The story follows a diary format of one of the latest clusters we added within our group. Thanks to all the team at Rocks, it was a great success, and there are many more clusters to come!</p>
