<h2>New Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>Support for Virtual Clusters</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual frontends and virtual compute nodes are now supported. The network for a VM frontend its VM compute nodes are contained within its own VLAN. A virtual cluster is added with "rocks add cluster fqdn=X ip=Y num-computes=Z". See "rocks add cluster help" for details.</p></p>
</li>
<li>Can build rolls outside of Rocks source tree</li>
<p>All roll building support files are under /opt/rocks/share/devel.</p></p>
<li>Can reconfigure a compute node's network without rebooting</li>
<p>Rocks commands were added to support this. See the documentation for the procedure.</p>
<li>Distribution moved to /export/rocks/install</li>
<p>No longer require NFS on the frontend to properly host a Rocks Distribution. This will make moving user accounts to an external NFS server easier.</p>
<li>Fine-grained control over the "boot" and "install" kernel for Xen VMs</li>
<p>Rocks commands where added to support this feature. For details, execute: "rocks help installprofile" and "rocks help bootprofile".</p>
