Rocks won two <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/509896.html">HPCwire 2005 Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most Significant New HPC Product (Readers' Choice)</li>
<li>Most Important Software Innovation (Editors' Choice)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This adds to the three awards won last year (<a href="http://www.taborcommunications.com/hpcwire/hpcwireWWW/04/1105/108684.html">HPCwire 2004 Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards)</a></p>
<p>
While the awards say "Rocks", it should say "Rocks Community".</p>
<p>
To all the developers and users, we thank you.</p>
