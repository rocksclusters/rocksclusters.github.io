<p><a href="http://sc07.supercomputing.org">Supercomputing 2007</a> is next month in Reno, Nevada.  As is our yearly tradition, rather than being in the SDSC Booth, we will all be spending our time in the NBCR Booth (<a href="http://sc07.supercomputing.org/?pg=floorplan.html">#3055</a>).  This year the NBCR Booth is on the far south side of the convention floor, right next door to NCHC (usually a brightly colored booth).</p>
<p>If you are attending the show, please stop by, say hello, also attend the Rocks BoF at 12:15pm on Weds.  If you would like to have a meeting with any of the Rocks group please send an email to sc07@rocksclusters.org so we can schedule accordingly.</p>
<p>You can view the current SC|07 schedule of the Rocks group on our <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=71amrmmr6lp5tktg6vm12rdb7g%40group.calendar.google.com">calendar</a>.</p>
