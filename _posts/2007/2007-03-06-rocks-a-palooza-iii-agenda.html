<p>Rocks-a-Palooza III will be held at AMD World Headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA. on May 16th and 17th 2007.</p>
<p>We encourage all to attend to learn the latest in Rocks, participate in hands-on tutorials and to meet users and developers from the Rocks community.</p>
<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pzJ8Gv7V6n_5ySByr7AFIew">agenda</a>, there are two tracks: one focused towards users, the other towards developers.</p>
<p>Attendees in the user track will walk away with in-depth knowledge of how Rocks clusters are built, used and maintained. We'll discuss the philosophies and rationales behind core Rocks services and utilities. An introduction to Rolls and Roll development will be presented. A hands-on lab will enable attendees to experiment with Rocks.</p>
<p>In the developer track, Roll development will be the focus. Roll internals will be presented as well as tips and techniques on how to debug and test a Roll. The main goal of this track is for attendees to walk away with a beta version of their own Roll. </p>
<p>Also, we'll host the kickoff meeting for the <i>Large Cluster Working Group</i>. This meeting will bring together application scientists, developers and administrators that run and use large clusters. The goal of this working group is to define a plan to develop the Large Cluster Roll that will benefit folks who run and use large-scale Rocks clusters. If you would like to participate in this meeting, send a note to <i>bruno@rocksclusters.org</i>. </p>
