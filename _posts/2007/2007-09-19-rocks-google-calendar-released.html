<p>Rocks developers have been using Google Calendar internally to help manage software releases, keep track of visitors, plan lunches, and other normal development activities.  We are also using it to manage our new Office Hours support activities.</p>
<p>All Rocks users are encouraged to subscribe to this calendar.  There is a button on the bottom right of this page, or you can just click on the button below.</p>
