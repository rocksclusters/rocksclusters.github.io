<p><i>Roy Dragseth of the HPC Group at the University of Tromso announces:</i></p>
<p>The long awaited pbs-roll release 4.3.0 is now ready for <a href="ftp://ftp.uit.no/pub/linux/rocks/pbs-roll/4.3.0">download</a>.</p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Torque upgraded to v2.1.8.</li>
<li>mpiexec upgraded to v0.82 + mvapich 0.9.9 support patch. mpiexec is now located under /opt/mpiexec to avoid clashing with openmpi.</li>
<li>maui is upgraded to v3.2.6p19.</li>
<li>Some system and ulimit parameters have been increased to support larger cluster sizes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading the roll without reinstalling the frontend should work as earlier, see <a href="https://lists.sdsc.edu/pipermail/npaci-rocks-discussion/2006-October/021516.html">Steve Jones's recipe</a>.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2></p>
<p>This will most probably be the last major release under the pbs-roll name. The plan is to rename the roll to torque-roll to better describe what software the roll actually contains.  The name change will be completed with the arrival of the Rocks v5.</p>
<p>Clusterresources.com, the developers and maintainers of torque and maui, will be involved in future releases. The hope is to establish a closer collaboration to speed up the development of the roll.</p>
