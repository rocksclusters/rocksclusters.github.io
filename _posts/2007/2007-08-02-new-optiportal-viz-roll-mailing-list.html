<p>There is now a dedicated mailing list for people building OptIPortals.<br />
This list is being hosted by <a href="http://www.calit2.net/">CalIT2</a> and can be found <a href="http://lists.calit2.net/mailman/listinfo/optiportal">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Rocks Viz Roll is currently a preferred method of building an OptIPortal.  Users of the Viz Roll that have a strong interest in Tile Display Walls and middleware like SAGE may wish to subscribe to this list.</p>
