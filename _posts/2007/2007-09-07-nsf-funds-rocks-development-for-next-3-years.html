<p>The National Science Foundation has announced award <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0721623">#0721623</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal was titled <em>SDCI: NMI: Improvement: The Rocks Cluster Toolkit and Extensions to Build User-Defined Cyberenvironments</em> and outlines our plan for the next three years of software development.  This award will fund the majority of Rocks development and support at the University of California San Diego into the year 2010.</p>
<p>We would like to thank our supportive and vocal user community for helping us demonstrate to NSF the need for direct funding of the Rocks project.  Thank you all, and of course thank you to the NSF.</p>
