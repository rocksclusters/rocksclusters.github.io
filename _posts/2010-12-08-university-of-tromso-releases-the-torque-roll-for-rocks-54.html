<p><i>Roy Dragseth of the University of Tromso announces:</i></p>
<p>The torque roll for Rocks 5.4.0 is now ready for download. Get the bits at:</p>
<p>ftp://ftp.uit.no/pub/linux/rocks/torque-roll/5.4.0</p>
<p>Most important software included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Torque v2.4.11</li>
<li>Maui v3.2.6p21 </li>
<li>mpiexec v0.84</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance Release</h2>
<p>This version of the torque roll is a maintenance release. It contains several bug fixes as well as refreshed software.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The Rocks way of installing the roll is as usual to reinstall your frontend and compute nodes, but you can also use the chain of commands to install a new roll on an existing frontend (with or without a previous version of the roll):</p>
<p># rocks add roll /path/to/torque/roll.iso<br />
# rocks enable roll torque<br />
# rocks create distro<br />
# rocks run roll torque | sh<br />
# reboot</p>
<p>After the the frontend comes back up you should do the following to populate the node list:</p>
<p># rocks sync config</p>
<p>then kickstart all your nodes</p>
<p># rocks run host /boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart</p>
<p>After the nodes are reinstalled they should automatically pop up in the queueing system.</p>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code of the roll can  be accessed from a public mercurial repository:  http://devsrc.cc.uit.no/hg/torque/</p>
