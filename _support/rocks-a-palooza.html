<li><a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2008/rocks-1.pdf">Workshop Goals and Rocks 5.0 Enhancements</a>
This session will focus on the new features of Rocks 5.0 (V) including support
for Xen-based virtual machines, enhancements/changes in the Rocks command
structure, and general support for Version 5.0 of CentOS/RHEL. In addition,
participants will have an opportunity to shape follow-on sessions for this
year's workshop. A refresher (or introduction) to the Rocks configuration
graph will be given. Participants are expected to have familiarity with
previous versions of Rocks.<p></p>
</li>
<li> <a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2008/rocks-2.pdf">Xen VMs, Virtual Clusters and Programmatic Partitioning</a>
The internals of Xen support in Rocks will be presented and dissected in detail. A preliminary roadmap for 
enhanced support for completely virtualized clusters (frontends and slave nodes) will be given.  New for 
Rocks 5.0 is the ability to fully program how a node partitions its local hard drives so that any 
partitioning policy can be implemented. Methods, techniques and examples of
partitioning schemes will be presented.<p></p>
</li>
<li> <a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2008/rocks-3.pdf">Customizing Rocks through Rolls.  How to Develop Your Own</a>
Rolls are the primary mechanism for customizing Rocks installations while enabling reproducibility to any number 
of clusters. Rolls can be commercial or open-source. ClusterCorp has produced several rolls and will describe 
their techniques and issues. Techniques for how Linux-based rolls are built and tested at UCSD. An 
introduction to the needed Rocks changes to support Solaris and
Rocks-on-Solaris will be presented.<p></p>
</li>
<li> <a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2008/rocks-4.pdf">Extending Functionality Through the Rocks Command Line Roll Screen Development</a>
As an extension to the previous session, roll-developers can add new installation screens and have them 
integrated seamlessly. Nadya Williams will describe here test harness that significantly improves the 
development of installation screens. The Rocks command line is the way rolls extend the command structure for 
Rocks. The Rocks Viz Roll will be used as key example of roll-based extension to support tiled-display 
clusters. The Solaris command set (currently under development) will be illustrative of how Rocks commands 
can work across different architectures.

This session will cover the basics of types and design of clusters (from Beowulf, to Tiled 
Walls, to High-Performance Supers).  The basic philosophy and first level design of Rocks will 
be presented as will comparisons to some other competitive methods. Getting started on Rocks will 
include building of real and virtual machines in Rocks 5.0 (V).<p></p>

While Rocks clusters are turnkey, users always to manage and customize their cluster. Introduction of 
the Rocks configuration graph and how to add new packages and configuration will be covered. Other 
common customization scenarios will be described.<p></p>

<li><a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2008/tutorial-9.pdf">Introduction to Building Your Own Roll</a>
Rolls are the way to customize Rocks. The implementation of Rolls is defined and the levels of 
customization is presented. A detailed example of building a straightforward

<span class="page-heading strongword">Rocks-A-Palooza III</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="post-meta">May 16, 17 2007, AMD World Headquarters, Sunnyvale, California </span> 

<p>In the agenda, there are two tracks: one focused towards users, the other
towards developers.</p>
<p> Attendees in the user track will walk away with in-depth knowledge of how
Rocks clusters are built, used and maintained. We'll discuss the philosophies
and rationales behind core Rocks services and utilities. An introduction to
Rolls and Roll development will be presented. A hands-on lab will enable
attendees to experiment with Rocks.</p>
<p> In the developer track, Roll development will be the focus. Roll internals
will be presented as well as tips and techniques on how to debug and test a
Roll. The main goal of this track is for attendees to walk away with a beta
version of their own Roll.</p>
<P> Also, we'll host the kickoff meeting for the Large Cluster Working Group. This
meeting will bring together application scientists, developers and
administrators that run and use large clusters. The goal of this working group
is to define a plan to develop the Large Cluster Roll that will benefit folks
who run and use large-scale Rocks clusters. If you would like to participate
in this meeting, send a note to bruno@rocksclusters.org.</P>

<span class="page-heading strongword">Rocks-A-Palooza I</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="post-meta">May 2005, La Jolla, California</span> 

<p> Rocks-A-Palooza I (held at the San Diego Supercomputer Center in La Jolla, California on May 18-19, 2005), was the first in a series of annual workshops for users and developers of the Rocks Cluster Distribution.</p>

<p> This first workshop focused on tutorials for both beginning and advanced users. This meeting had two tracks: one for users and another for developers. The user track (1) included an introduction to clusters, grids, Rocks, and Roll development. The developer track (2) focused entirely on Roll development.</p>

<p>
The <a href="/assets/tutorials/rocksapalooza/2005">slides</a> for all presentations are available.</p>
