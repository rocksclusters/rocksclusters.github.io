See [Current Cluster Registration Summary][1]

### Rationale

The National Science Foundation is our primary funding vehicle. While we have several 
measurements of Rocks usage (downloads, number of list subscribers, number of posts), 
the registry gives our funding agency an additional and significant device for 
evaluation.  It also lets us know which platforms are the most important to Rocks 
users and what sizes of clusters our software must support.

Please take the time to register your cluster if you have not already.  
The registration is anonymous. The only required fields are 

- Cluster name (not FQDN) 
- Number of CPUs
- CPU clock rate
- Rocks version
