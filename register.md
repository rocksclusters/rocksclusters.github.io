[Current List](/rocks-register/)

[Register Your Cluster](/rocks-register/insert.php)

### Rationale

The National Science Foundation is our primary funding vehicle. While we have several 
measurements of Rocks usage (downloads, number of list subscribers, number of posts), 
the registry gives our funding agency an additional and significant device for 
evaluation.  It also lets us know which platforms are the most important to Rocks 
users and what sizes of clusters our software must support.

Please take the time to register your cluster if you haven't already and update 
your current registration if your current configuration has changed.  As in the past,
we don't add folks who register to any new email lists. You won't get any more mail 
from us than you do now.
