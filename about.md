Rocks is an open-source Linux cluster distribution that enables end users to
easily build computational clusters, grid endpoints and visualization
tiled-display walls. Hundreds of researchers from around the world have used
Rocks to deploy their own cluster (see the [Rocks Cluster Register](/register) )

Since May 2000, the Rocks group has been addressing the difficulties of
deploying manageable clusters. We have been driven by one goal: make clusters
easy. By easy we mean easy to deploy, manage, upgrade and scale. We are driven
by this goal to help deliver the computational power of clusters to a wide
range of scientific users. It is clear that making stable and manageable
parallel computing platforms available to a wide range of scientists will aid
immensely in improving the state of the art in parallel tools.
