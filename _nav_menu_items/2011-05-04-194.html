<p>Rocks is an open-source Linux cluster distribution that enables end users to easily build computational clusters, grid endpoints and visualization tiled-display walls. Hundreds of researchers from around the world have used Rocks to deploy their own cluster (see the Rocks Cluster Register).</p>
<p>Since May 2000, the Rocks group has been addressing the difficulties of deploying manageable clusters. We have been driven by one goal: make clusters easy. By easy we mean easy to deploy, manage, upgrade and scale. We are driven by this goal to help deliver the computational power of clusters to a wide range of scientific users. It is clear that making stable and manageable parallel computing platforms available to a wide range of scientists will aid immensely in improving the state of the art in parallel tools.</p>
