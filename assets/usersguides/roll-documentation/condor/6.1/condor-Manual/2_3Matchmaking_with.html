2.3 Matchmaking with ClassAds
</H1>

<P>
Before you learn about how to submit a job, it is important to
understand how Condor allocates resources. 
<A NAME="1604"></A>
Understanding the
unique framework by which Condor matches submitted jobs with machines is
the key to getting the most from Condor's scheduling algorithm. 

<P>
Condor simplifies job submission by acting as a matchmaker of ClassAds.
Condor's ClassAds
<A NAME="1605"></A>
are analogous to the classified advertising section of the
newspaper. Sellers advertise specifics about what they have to sell,
hoping to attract a buyer. Buyers may advertise specifics about what
they wish to purchase. Both buyers and sellers list constraints that
need to be satisfied.
For instance, a buyer has a maximum spending limit, 
and a seller requires a minimum purchase price.
Furthermore, both want to rank requests to their own advantage.
Certainly a seller would rank
one offer of $50 dollars higher than a different
offer of $25.
In Condor, users submitting
jobs can be thought of as buyers of compute resources and machine owners
are sellers. 

<P>
All machines in a Condor pool advertise their attributes,
<A NAME="1606"></A>
such as
available memory, CPU type and speed, virtual memory size, current
load average, along with other static and dynamic properties.
This machine ClassAd
<A NAME="1607"></A>
also advertises under what conditions it is
willing to run a Condor job and what type of job it would prefer. These
policy attributes can reflect the individual terms and preferences by
which all the different owners have graciously allowed their machine to
be part of the Condor pool. 
You may
advertise that your machine is only willing to run jobs at night
and when there is no keyboard activity on your machine.
In addition, you may
advertise a preference (rank) for running jobs submitted by you
or one of your co-workers. 

<P>
Likewise, when submitting a job, you specify a ClassAd with
your requirements and preferences.
The ClassAd
<A NAME="1608"></A>
includes the
type of machine you  wish to use. For instance, perhaps you are
looking for the fastest floating point performance available.
You want Condor to rank available machines
based upon floating point performance. Or, perhaps you
care only that the machine has a minimum of 128 Mbytes of RAM.
Or, perhaps you will
take any machine you can get! These job attributes and requirements
are bundled up into a job ClassAd.

<P>
Condor plays the role of a matchmaker by continuously reading
all the job ClassAds and all the machine ClassAds, 
matching and ranking job ads with machine ads.
Condor makes certain that all
requirements in both ClassAds are satisfied. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00331000000000000000">
2.3.1 Inspecting Machine ClassAds with condor_status</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="1610"></A>
Once Condor is installed,
you will get a feel for what
a machine ClassAd does by trying
the <I>condor_status</I> command.
Try the <I>condor_status</I> command to get
a summary of information from
ClassAds about the resources available in your pool.
Type <I>condor_status</I> and hit enter to see a summary 
similar to the following:

</PRE>... 

<P>
The <I>condor_status</I> command has options that summarize machine ads 
in a variety of ways.
For example,
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_status -available</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>shows only machines which are
willing to run jobs now. 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_status -run</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>shows only machines
which are currently running jobs.  
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_status -long</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>lists the machine ClassAds for all machines
in the pool.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Refer to the <I>condor_status</I> command 
reference page located on page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_status.html#man-condor-status"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>
for a complete description of the <I>condor_status</I> command.

<P>
The following shows a portion of a machine ClassAd
<A NAME="1625"></A>
<A NAME="1626"></A>
for a single machine: turunmaa.cs.wisc.edu. Some of the listed
attributes are used by
Condor for scheduling. Other attributes are for information purposes.
An important point is that <I>any</I> of the attributes in a
machine ClassAd can be utilized at job submission time as part of a request
or preference on what machine to use. Additional attributes
can be easily added. For example, your site administrator can
add a physical location attribute to your machine ClassAds.
