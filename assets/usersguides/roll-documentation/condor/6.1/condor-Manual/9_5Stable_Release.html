Bugs Fixed:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><U><I>Security Item</I></U>: Some code that was no longer used was removed.  The presence

<LI><U><I>Security Item</I></U>: Some code that was no longer used was removed.  The presence
of this code could have lead to a Denial-of-Service attack which would allow
an attacker to remove another user's idle job.  (CVE-2012-3491)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><U><I>Security Item</I></U>: Filesystem (FS) authentication was improved to check the UNIX
permissions of the directory used for authentication.  Without this, an
attacker may have been able to impersonate another submitter on the same submit
machine.  (CVE-2012-3492)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><U><I>Security Item</I></U>: Although not user-visible, there were multiple updates to
remove places in the code where potential buffer overruns could occur, thus
removing potential attacks.  None were known to be exploitable.

cycle until after the cycle completes.
<A NAME="tex2html316"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2931">(Ticket #2931).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a potential infinite loop in the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> for gt2
grid universe jobs. If the GRAM jobmanager was listening on a different
port than the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> expected, the <I>condor_gridmanager</I>

  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2570">(Ticket #2570).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Added logic to the <I>condor_negotiator</I> to negotiate with full group 
quota instead of allocated-slots when no surplus sharing is in effect, to
address a bug where groups could fail to claim weighted slots.
<A NAME="tex2html319"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2958">(Ticket #2958).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.6.2 that affects jobs run via
<I>glexec</I>.  
When <I>glexec</I> was configured in log-only mode, 
Condor failed to execute the job,
but reported that the job exited with exit code 1.
In such cases, 
the <TT>stderr</TT> of the job contained the following message:
<PRE>
fdpass_recv error on new_sock_fd
</PRE>
<A NAME="tex2html320"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2840">(Ticket #2840).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a rare bug in which if the <I>condor_startd</I> was configured 
to use partitionable slots,
it was possible for the <I>condor_startd</I> to get partitioned into more slots
than there were resources.
That is, it was possible for a four cpu <I>condor_startd</I>
to split into five slots.

  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2816">(Ticket #2816).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a rare bug seen with parallel universe jobs,
in which if a claim was removed as the <I>condor_shadow</I> was starting up, 
all ranks of the job would never completely start.
<A NAME="tex2html322"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2786">(Ticket #2786).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that caused disk capacity to be under-reported 
on Windows platforms for drives with 1TB or more of free space.
<A NAME="tex2html323"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2798">(Ticket #2798).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that caused communication failure in some cases,
 after the failure of authentication, when authentication was configured
to be optional.
<A NAME="tex2html324"
  HREF="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2845">(Ticket #2845).</A>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in which if the configuration variable <TT>EVENT_LOG</TT> <A NAME="57452"></A> <A NAME="57453"></A> was 
set but the defined file was not writable,
the user's job log would not be written to. 
This bug would have been observable with DAGMan.

<LI>NorduGrid ARC LDAP servers that return attributes in an unexpected
order no longer cause the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> to exit.

Version 7.6.5
</H2>

<P>
Release Notes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Condor version 7.6.5 released on December 28, 2011.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Restored the semantics of <TT>GROUP_AUTOREGROUP</TT> <A NAME="57516"></A> <A NAME="57517"></A> to the
behavior it exhibited before Hierarchical Group Quotas were introduced
in Condor version 7.5.6.
That behavior has submitters with no accounting group,
which are listed as <TT>&lt;none&gt;</TT>, negotiate last.
And, in addition, any accounting groups with <TT>GROUP_AUTOREGROUP</TT>
enabled negotiate both normally and then also along with the 
submitters with no accounting group.
For Condor versions 7.5.6 through 7.6.4, configuration variable
<TT>GROUP_AUTOREGROUP</TT> (or <TT>GROUP_AUTOREGROUP_&lt;groupname&gt;</TT>)
was a synonym for 
<TT>GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS</TT> <A NAME="57525"></A> <A NAME="57526"></A> 
(or <TT>GROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS_&lt;groupname&gt;</TT>).
They now implement distinct features,
and it is not legal to set both to <TT>True</TT> in the configuration
for the <I>condor_negotiator</I>.

<LI>The new Windows-only <I>condor_rmdir</I> was included in Condor version 7.6.0,
but there was no version history entry for this introduced tool at release.
This item attempts to correct that oversight, 
as well as identify that usage of <I>condor_rmdir</I>,
instead of the built-in Windows <I>rmdir</I>, 
is enabled by default.
<I>condor_rmdir</I> worked correctly in Condor version 7.6.0, 
contained a bug in Condor version 7.6.1,
and was fixed in Condor version 7.6.2.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
New Features:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Improved how <I>condor_dagman</I> deals with certain parse errors:
missing node name or submit description file in JOB lines.
Also, <I>condor_dagman</I>
now prints DAG input file lines as they are parsed, 
if the debug verbosity setting is 6 or above,
as set with the <I>condor_submit_dag</I> command line option <B>-debug</B>.

</UL>

<P>
Bugs Fixed:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the <I>condor_negotiator</I> that impacted the processing 
of machine <TT>RANK</TT> such that <I>condor_startd</I> <TT>RANK</TT>
preemption only occurred if the preempting user had sufficient user priority 
to claim another machine. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>condor_ssh_to_job</I> did not work on systems using the 
dash shell for <I>/bin/sh</I>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>condor_ssh_to_job</I> now works with jobs that are run via 
<I>glexec</I>. Previously, it did not. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When <I>glexec</I> was configured with <TT>linger=on</TT>,
the <I>condor_starter</I> would become unresponsive for the duration of the job. 
For jobs longer than the value set by configuration variable
<TT>NOT_RESPONDING_TIMEOUT</TT>,
this caused the job to be aborted. 
This also prevented job resource usage monitoring from working 
while the job was running.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in hierarchical group quotas that caused 
a warning to be logged, despite correct implementation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>condor_preen</I> now properly respects the convention that
the <B>-debug</B> option causes <TT>dprintf()</TT> logging to <TT>stderr</TT>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem introduced in Condor version 7.5.5 
that could cause the <I>condor_schedd</I> to crash when a job was removed 
during negotiation or when an idle parallel universe job left the queue. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem that sometimes caused the <I>condor_procd</I> to die.
The chain of events for this fixed bug were that
the <I>condor_startd</I> killed the <I>condor_starter</I> due to unresponsiveness,
and the <I>condor_procd</I> would die.
Then <I>condor_startd</I> logged the message
<TT>ProcD has failed</TT> and the <I>condor_startd</I> exited. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem introduced in Condor version 7.6.1 
that caused the <I>condor_shadow</I> to crash without successfully putting the job 
on hold when the user log could not be opened for writing. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>condor_history</I> no longer crashes when given a constraint expression 
longer than 512 characters. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>PBS and LSF grid jobs that arrive in a queue via Condor-C
or remote submission again work properly. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix a bug that can cause the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> to crash 
when a CREAM job ClassAd is missing the <TT>X509UserProxy</TT> attribute. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix a bug that caused CREAM jobs to have incomplete input files,
if the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> crashed during transfer of those input files. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fix a bug in <I>condor_submit</I> that caused grid jobs intended for 
CREAM services whose names contain extra dashes to become held. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in which <I>condor_submit</I> would try, 
but fail to open the Deltacloud password file,
when the file name was dependent on an expression specified with <TT>$$()</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the <TT>Owner</TT> attribute was not set in the ClassAd associated
with a cluster of jobs,
shared spooled executables were not correctly cleaned up.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug for 64-bit versions of Windows in which the
user <TT>condor-reuse-slot&lt;N&gt;</TT> showed up on the login screen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5,
which changed the default value of the configuration variable
<TT>INVALID_LOG_FILES</TT> <A NAME="58032"></A> <A NAME="58033"></A> from the empty set to a file called <TT>core</TT>.
This resulted in core files being removed unexpectedly by <I>condor_preen</I>,
and that complicated debugging of Condor.
Previous behavior has been restored.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug existing since Condor version 7.5.5 on Windows platforms.
The installer installed Java jar files in the correct <code>$(BIN)</code> directory,
while the value for the configuration variable 
<TT>JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT</TT> utilized the obsolete <code>$(LIB)</code>
directory.
The installer now correctly sets <TT>JAVA_CLASSPATH_DEFAULT</TT> 
to the <code>$(BIN)</code> directory.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a problem causing Condor to fail to start when
privsep was enabled and the environment had any variables
containing newlines.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Known Bugs:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>For Condor versions 7.6.2, 7.6.1, and 7.6.0,
a bug causes parallel universe jobs to be preempted upon 
renewal of the job lease, 
which by default will happen within 20 minutes, 
essentially meaning that no parallel universe job that takes
longer than 20 minutes can ever finish.
The work around for this bug is to place the following
configuration variable in the configuration of the submit machine:
<PRE>
  STARTD_SENDS_ALIVES = FALSE
</PRE>
A <I>condor_reconfig</I> is required, 
after which the preempted parallel universe jobs will then be
able to run to completion.

Bugs Fixed:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5 caused the <I>condor_schedd</I>
to die when its attempt to claim a slot for a parallel universe job 
was rejected by the <I>condor_startd</I>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>condor_q</I> <B>-analyze</B> failed to provide detailed analysis of
the job's requirements expression when the expression contained ClassAd
function calls in some cases. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed an incorrect exit code from <I>condor_q</I> 
when invoked with the <B>-name</B> option and using Quill.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a segmentation fault bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5,
in the checkpoint and restart of jobs using compressed checkpoint images
under the standard universe.
By default, Condor will not compress checkpoints under the standard universe.
Jobs which do not compress their checkpoints were immune to this bug.  
Compressed checkpoints are only available in 32-bit versions of Condor.
Generation of checkpoints in 64-bit versions of Condor are unaffected.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In Condor version 7.6.0, the <I>condor_schedd</I> would create a 
spool directory for every job. The corrected and previous behavior 
has now been restored, 
which is to create a spool directory only when needed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.2,
that caused the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon to crash
if any machine ClassAds contained cyclical attribute references.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that caused usage by <B>nice_user</B> jobs to
be charged to the user directly rather than `nice-user.<I>user</I>'.
This bug was introduced in the 7.5 series.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed bugs in the RPM init script that could cause some 
shutdown failures to be unreported, 
and they could cause status requests,
such as <TT>service condor status</TT>,
to always report Condor as inactive.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> that could cause a crash 
when a grid type <B>amazon</B> job was missing required attributes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed bug in the <I>condor_shadow</I>, in which it would treat 
the closed socket to the execute machine as an error,
after both it had asked for the claim to be deactivated and the 
<I>condor_schedd</I> daemon was busy.  
As a result, a busy <I>condor_schedd</I> could result in the job being re-run.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The matchmaking attributes 
<TT>SubmitterUserResourcesInUse</TT> and <TT>RemoteUserResourcesInUse</TT> 
no longer ignore <TT>SlotWeight</TT>, if used by the <I>condor_negotiator</I>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>On Windows, the <I>condor_kbdd</I> daemon was missing changes to the
port on which the <I>condor_startd</I> was listening.
This resulted in failure of the <I>condor_kbdd</I> to send updates in 
keyboard and mouse activity,
further causing the failure of policy implementation that relied upon 
knowledge of the activity.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug present throughout ClassAds,
in which expressions expecting a floating point value returned an error,
if the expression actually evaluated to a boolean.
This is most common in machine <TT>RANK</TT> expressions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon,
which caused a crash if the <I>condor_negotiator</I> was reconfigured 
during a negotiation cycle, 
but only if hierarchical group quotas were in use.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in which when submitting a job into the <I>condor_schedd</I>
remotely, or with spooling, 
the file transfer plug-ins activated on the submit machine 
and pulled down all the specified URLs in the transfer list 
to the spool directory. 
This behavior has been changed so that URLs are only downloaded 
when the job is actually running with a <I>condor_starter</I> above it. 
This is usually on an execute node, but could also be in the local universe. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Removed the requirement that the Condor GAHP needs DAEMON-level 
authorization access to the <I>condor_gridmanager</I>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>On Windows platforms only, 
fixed a bug that could cause a sporadic access violation 
when a Condor daemon spawned another process.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that would cause the <I>condor_startd</I> to 
incorrectly report <TT>Benchmarking</TT> as its activity, instead of <TT>Idle</TT>
when there was a problem launching the benchmarking programs. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in which the <I>condor_startd</I> can get stuck in a loop,
trying to execute an invalid, non-existent Daemon ClassAd Hook job. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in which the dedicated scheduler did not correctly 
deactivate claims,
tending to result in jobs that appear to move back and forth between
the <TT>Idle</TT> and <TT>Running</TT> states,
with the <I>condor_shadow</I> daemon exiting each time with status 108.

<P>
Release Notes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Condor version 7.6.0 released on April 19, 2011.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prior to Condor version 7.5.0, commenting out <TT>PREEN</TT> in the
  default configuration file disabled <I>condor_preen</I>.  
  Starting in Condor version 7.5.0,
  there was an internal default value for <TT>PREEN</TT>, so if
  the configuration variable was not set in any configuration file,
  <I>condor_preen</I> would still run.
  To disable this functionality, <TT>PREEN</TT> can be explicitly set to
  nothing.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
New Features:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Condor can now create and manage virtual machine instances in a
cloud service via Deltacloud. This is done via the new
<B>deltacloud</B> grid type in the grid universe.
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:Deltacloud">5.3.8</A> for details.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improved scalability of submission of cream grid type jobs.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The new configuration variable <TT>DELTACLOUD_GAHP</TT> <A NAME="58111"></A> <A NAME="58112"></A> specifies
where the <I>deltacloud_gahp</I> binary is located. This binary is used to
manage deltacloud grid type jobs in the grid universe.
In a normal Condor installation, the value should be
<TT>$(SBIN)/deltacloud_gahp</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Several new job ClassAd attributes have been added to support
the deltacloud grid type in the grid universe.
These attributes are taken from the submit description file:
<TT>DeltacloudUsername</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudPasswordFile</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudImageId</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudRealmId</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudHardwareProfile</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudHardwareProfileCpu</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudHardwareProfileMemory</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudHardwareProfileStorage</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudKeyname</TT>, and
<TT>DeltacloudUserData</TT>.
These attributes are set by Condor when the instance runs:
<TT>DeltacloudAvailableActions</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudPrivateNetworkAddresses</TT>,
<TT>DeltacloudPublicNetworkAddresses</TT>.
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:Deltacloud">5.3.8</A> for details of running jobs under
Deltacloud, and see section&nbsp;<A HREF="11_Appendix_A.html#sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes">11</A>
for definitions of these job ClassAd attributes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The configuration variable <TT>JAVA_MAXHEAP_ARGUMENT</TT> <A NAME="58131"></A> <A NAME="58132"></A> 
  has been removed. 
  This means that Java universe jobs will now run with the JVM's 
  default maximum heap setting,
  unless specified otherwise by the administrator using the configuration
  of <TT>JAVA_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS</TT> <A NAME="58136"></A> <A NAME="58137"></A>,
  or by the job via 
  <B>java_vm_args</B> in the submit description file
  as described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_8Java_Applications.html#sec:Java">2.8</A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The configuration variable <TT>TRUST_UID_DOMAIN</TT> <A NAME="58142"></A> <A NAME="58143"></A>
  was set to <TT>True</TT> in the default <TT>condor_config.local</TT>
  in the rpm and Debian packages.  This is no longer the case.
  This setting will therefore use the default value <TT>False</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The configuration variable <TT>NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL</TT> <A NAME="58150"></A> <A NAME="58151"></A> was set
  to 20 in the default <TT>condor_config.local</TT> in the rpm and
  Debian packages.  This is no longer the case.  This setting
  therefore will use the default value 60.

<P>

Bugs Fixed:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed a bug in <I>condor_dagman</I> that caused it to fail when in recovery
mode in the face of a specific combination of node job failures with
retries.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that resulted in the spooled user log not being
  fetched by <I>condor_transfer_data</I>.  Prior to Condor version 7.5.4, this
  problem affected spooled jobs submitted with an explicit list of
  output files to transfer.  In Condor version 7.5.4, this problem also
  affected spooled jobs that auto-detected output files.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When a job is submitted with the <B>-spool</B> option to <I>condor_submit</I>,
the <I>condor_schedd</I> now correctly writes the submit event to the user log 
in its spool directory. 
Previously, it would try to write the event using the user
log path given to <I>condor_submit</I> by the user, 
which <I>condor_submit</I> may not have access to.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a file descriptor leak in the <I>condor_vm-gahp</I>. The leak would
cause the daemon to fail if a VMware job ran for more than 16 hours on a
Linux machine.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in <I>condor_dagman</I> that caused it to treat any dollar
sign in the log file name of a node job's submit description file
as an illegal <I>condor_dagman</I> macro.
Now only the sequence of characters <TT>$(</TT> delimits a macro.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Known Bugs:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>There are two known issues related to the automatic creation
of checkpoints with the Condor checkpointing library in 
Condor version 7.6.0.
The first is that compression of
standalone checkpoints is disabled for 32-bit binaries.
It was always disabled previously, for 64-bit binaries.
A standalone checkpoint is one that is run outside
of Condor's standard universe.  The second problem has to do with compressed
32-bit checkpoint files within the standard universe.
If a user requests a compressed 32-bit checkpoint in the standard universe,
the resulting checkpoint will not be compressed.
As with standalone checkpoints, this has never been supported
in 64-bit binaries.  We hope to fix both problems in 
Condor version 7.6.1.
