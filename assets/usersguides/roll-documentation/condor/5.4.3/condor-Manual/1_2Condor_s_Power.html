1.2 Condor's Power
</H1>

<P>
Condor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing
(HTC) environment.
It effectively utilizes the computing power of workstations that
communicate over a network.
Condor can manage a dedicated cluster of workstations.
Its power comes from the
ability to effectively harness non-dedicated,
preexisting resources under distributed ownership. 
<A NAME="1203"></A>

<P>
A user submits the job to Condor.
Condor finds an available machine on the network and begins
running the job on that machine.
Condor has the capability to detect that a machine running a Condor job
is no longer available (perhaps because the owner of the machine
came back from lunch and started typing on the keyboard).
It can checkpoint 
<A NAME="1204"></A>
the job and move (migrate)
<A NAME="1205"></A>
the jobs to a different machine which would otherwise be idle.
Condor continues the job on the new machine from
precisely where it left off.

<P>
In those cases where Condor can checkpoint and migrate a job,
Condor makes it easy to maximize the number of machines which can run
a job.
In this case, there is no requirement for machines to
share file systems (for example, with NFS or AFS),
so that machines across an entire enterprise can run a job,
including machines in different administrative domains.

<P>
Condor can be a real time saver when a job
must be run many (hundreds of) different times,
<A NAME="1206"></A>
perhaps with hundreds of different data sets.
With one command, all of the hundreds of jobs are submitted to Condor.
Depending upon the number of machines in the Condor pool,
dozens or even hundreds of otherwise idle machines
can be running the job at any given moment.

<P>
Condor does not require an account (login) on machines where it runs a job.
Condor can do this because of its <I>remote system call</I>
<A NAME="1208"></A>
technology,
which traps
library calls for such operations as reading or writing from disk
files.
The calls are transmitted over the network to be performed on the machine
where the job was submitted.

<P>
<A NAME="1209"></A>
<A NAME="1210"></A>
Condor provides powerful resource management by
match-making resource
<A NAME="1211"></A>
owners with resource consumers.
This is the cornerstone of a successful HTC environment.
Other compute cluster resource management
systems attach properties to the job queues themselves,
resulting in user confusion over which queue to use as well as administrative
hassle in constantly adding and editing queue properties to satisfy user
demands.
Condor implements 
<I>ClassAds</I>,
<A NAME="1213"></A>
a clean design that simplifies the user's submission of jobs.

<P>
ClassAds work in a fashion similar to the newspaper classified
advertising want-ads. All machines in the Condor pool advertise their
resource properties, both static and dynamic,
such as available RAM memory, CPU type, CPU speed,
virtual memory size, physical location, and current load average,
in a <I>resource offer</I> ad.
<A NAME="1215"></A>
A user specifies a <I>resource request</I> ad
<A NAME="1217"></A>
when submitting a job.
The request defines both the required and a desired set of properties
of the resource to run the job.
Condor acts as a broker by matching and ranking resource
offer ads with resource request ads, making certain that all
requirements in both ads are satisfied.
During this match-making process,
Condor also considers several layers of priority values:
the priority the user assigned to the resource request ad,
the priority of the user which submitted the ad,
and desire of
machines in the pool to accept certain types of ads over others.
