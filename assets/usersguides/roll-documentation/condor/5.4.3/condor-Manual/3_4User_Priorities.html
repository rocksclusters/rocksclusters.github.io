3.4 User Priorities and Negotiation
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="25677"></A>
<A NAME="25678"></A>
Condor uses priorities to determine machine allocation for jobs.
This section details the priorities and the allocation of
machines (negotiation).

<P>
For accounting purposes, each user is identified by username@uid_domain.
Each user is assigned a priority value even if submitting jobs from
different machines in the same domain, or even if submitting from multiple
machines in the different domains.

<P>
The numerical priority value assigned to a user is inversely related to the 
<I>goodness</I> of the priority.
A user with a numerical priority of 5 gets 
more resources than a user with a numerical priority of 50.
There are two 
priority values assigned to Condor users:

<UL>
<LI>Real User Priority (RUP), which measures resource usage of the 
		user.
</LI>
<LI>Effective User Priority (EUP), which determines the number of
		resources the user can get.
</LI>
</UL>
This section describes these two priorities and how they affect resource
allocations in Condor.
Documentation on configuring and controlling 
priorities may be found in section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_3Configuration.html#sec:Negotiator-Config-File-Entries">3.3.17</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00441000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:RUP"></A>
<A NAME="25684"></A>
<A NAME="25685"></A>
<BR>
3.4.1 Real User Priority (RUP)
</H2>
A user's RUP measures the resource usage of the user 
through time.
Every user begins with a RUP of one half (0.5), and
at steady state, the RUP of a user equilibrates to the number of resources 
used by that user.  Therefore, if a specific user continuously uses exactly 
ten resources for a long period of time, the RUP of that user stabilizes at 
ten.

<P>
However, if the user decreases the number of resources used, the RUP
gets better.  The rate at which the priority value decays 
can be set by the macro <TT>PRIORITY_HALFLIFE</TT> <A NAME="25866"></A> <A NAME="25867"></A>, a time period 
defined in seconds.   Intuitively, if the <TT>PRIORITY_HALFLIFE</TT> <A NAME="25871"></A> <A NAME="25872"></A> in a pool 
is set to 86400 (one day), and if a user whose RUP was 10 removes all his 
jobs, the user's RUP would be 5 one day later, 2.5 two days later,
and so on.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00442000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:EUP"></A>
<A NAME="25689"></A>
<A NAME="25690"></A>
<BR>
3.4.2 Effective User Priority (EUP)
</H2>
The effective user priority (EUP) of a user is used to determine
how many resources that user may receive.
The EUP is linearly related to the RUP
by a <I>priority factor</I> which may be defined on a per-user basis.
Unless otherwise configured, the priority factor for all users is 1.0,
and so the EUP is the same as the the RUP.
However, if desired, the priority factors of
specific users (such as remote submitters) can be increased so that 
others are served preferentially.

<P>
The number of resources that a user may receive is inversely related
to the ratio between the EUPs of submitting users.
Therefore user <I>A</I> with EUP=5 will receive
twice as many resources as user <I>B</I> with EUP=10 and four times as many 
resources as user <I>C</I> with EUP=20.
However, if <I>A</I> does not use the full number
of allocated resources,
the available resources are repartitioned and distributed among
remaining users according to the inverse ratio rule.

<P>
Condor supplies mechanisms to directly support two policies in which EUP may
be useful:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Nice users</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A job may be submitted with the parameter 
	<TT>nice_user</TT> set to TRUE in the submit command file.
	A nice user job gets its RUP boosted by the 
	<TT>NICE_USER_PRIO_FACTOR</TT> <A NAME="25877"></A> <A NAME="25878"></A> priority factor specified in the 
	configuration file, leading to a (usually very large) EUP.
	This corresponds to a low priority for resources.
	These jobs are therefore equivalent to Unix background jobs,
	which use resources not used by other Condor users.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Remote Users</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The flocking feature of Condor (see
	section&nbsp;<A HREF="5_2Connecting_Condor.html#sec:Flocking">5.2</A>) allows the <I>condor_schedd</I> to
	submit to more than one pool.
	In addition, the submit-only feature allows a user to run a
	<I>condor_schedd</I> that is submitting jobs into another pool.
	In such situations, submitters from other domains
	can submit to the local pool.
	It is often desirable to have Condor treat local users
	preferentially over these remote users.
	If configured, Condor will boost the RUPs of remote users by
	<TT>REMOTE_PRIO_FACTOR</TT> <A NAME="25886"></A> <A NAME="25887"></A>
	specified in the configuration file,
	thereby lowering their priority for resources.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The priority boost factors for individual users can be set with the 
<B>setfactor</B> option of <I>condor_userprio</I>.
Details may be found in the <I>condor_userprio</I> manual page 
on page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_userprio.html#man-condor-userprio"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

3.4.3 Priorities in Negotiation and Preemption
</H2>
Priorities are used to ensure that users get their fair share of resources.  
The priority values are used at allocation time, meaning during
negotiation and matchmaking.
Therefore, there are ClassAd attributes that take on defined values
only during negotiation, making them ephemeral.
In addition to allocation, Condor may preempt a machine claim 
and reallocate it when conditions change.

<P>
Too many preemptions lead to thrashing,
a condition in which negotiation for a machine identifies a
new job with a better priority most every cycle.
Each job is, in turn, preempted, and no job finishes.
To avoid this situation, the <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT> <A NAME="25897"></A> <A NAME="25898"></A> 
configuration variable is defined for and used only by 
the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon
to specify the conditions that must be met for a preemption to
occur.  It is usually defined to deny preemption if a current running
job has been running for a relatively short period of time.  This
effectively limits the number of preemptions per resource per time
interval.
Note that <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT> only applies to preemptions
due to user priority.  It does not have any effect if the machine's 
<TT>RANK</TT>
expression prefers a different job, or if the machine's policy
causes the job to vacate due to other activity on the machine.
See section <A HREF="3_5Policy_Configuration.html#sec:Disabling_Preemption">3.5.9</A> for a general discussion of
limiting preemption.

<P>
The following ephemeral attributes may be used within policy definitions.
Care should be taken when using these attributes, 
due to their ephemeral nature;
they are not always defined, so the usage of an expression to 
check if defined such as
<PRE>
  (RemoteUserPrio =?= UNDEFINED)
</PRE>
is likely necessary.

<P>
Within these attributes, those with names that contain the
string <TT>Submitter</TT> refer to characteristics about the candidate job's user;
those with names that contain the string <TT>Remote</TT>
refer to characteristics about the user currently using the resource.
Further,  those with names that end with the
string <TT>ResourcesInUse</TT> have values that may change within
the time period associated with a single negotiation cycle.
Therefore, the configuration variables <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS_STABLE</TT> <A NAME="25909"></A> <A NAME="25910"></A>
and and <TT>PREEMPTION_RANK_STABLE</TT> <A NAME="25914"></A> <A NAME="25915"></A> exist to inform the 
<I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon that values may change.
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_3Configuration.html#param:PreemptionRequirementsStable">3.3.17</A> on
page&nbsp;<A HREF="3_3Configuration.html#param:PreemptionRequirementsStable"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for

3.4.5 Negotiation

<P>
Negotiation is the method Condor undergoes periodically to
match queued jobs with resources capable of running jobs.
The <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon is responsible for
negotiation.

<P>
During a negotiation cycle, the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon
accomplishes the following ordered list of items.

<OL>
<LI>Build a list of all possible resources,
  regardless of the state of those resources.
</LI>
<LI>Obtain a list of all job submitters (for the entire pool).
</LI>
<LI>Sort the list of all job submitters based on EUP
  (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:EUP">3.4.2</A> for an explanation of EUP).
  The submitter with the best priority is first within the sorted list.
</LI>
<LI>Iterate until there are either no more resources to match,
  or no more jobs to match.
    <DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>For each submitter (in EUP order):
        <DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>For each submitter, get each job.
	  Since jobs may be submitted from more than one machine
	  (hence to more than one <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon),
	  here is a further definition of the ordering of these jobs.
	  With jobs from a single <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon, 
	  jobs are typically returned in job priority order.
	  When more than one <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon is involved,
	  they are contacted in an undefined order. 
	  All jobs from a single <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon are considered
	  before moving on to the next.
	  For each job:

		  <TT>job.requirements</TT> evaluates to <TT>False</TT>,
		  skip this machine
</LI>
<LI>If the machine is in the Claimed state, but
		  not running a job, skip this machine.
</LI>
<LI>If this machine is not running a job, add it to
		  the potential match list by reason of
		  No Preemption.
</LI>
<LI>If the machine is running a job
                    
<UL>
<LI>If the <TT>machine.RANK</TT> on this job is
		    better than the running job, add this machine to the
		    potential match list by reason of Rank.
</LI>
<LI>If the EUP of this job is better than the EUP
		    of the currently running job, and
		    <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT> is <TT>True</TT>,
		    and the <TT>machine.RANK</TT> on this job is not worse
		    than the currently running job, add this machine to the
		    potential match list by reason of Priority.
                    
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Of machines in the potential match list, sort by
		<TT>NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK</TT>, <TT>job.RANK</TT>,
		<TT>NEGOTIATOR_POST_JOB_RANK</TT>, Reason for claim
		(No Preemption, then Rank, then Priority),
		<TT>PREEMPTION_RANK</TT>
</LI>
<LI>The job is assigned to the top machine on the

<P>
The <I>condor_negotiator</I> asks the <I>condor_schedd</I> for the 
"next job" from a given submitter/user.
Typically, the <I>condor_schedd</I> returns jobs in the order of
job priority.
If priorities are the same,
job submission time is used; older jobs go first.
If a cluster has multiple procs in it and one of the jobs cannot be matched,
the <I>condor_schedd</I> will not return any more jobs in that cluster
on that negotiation pass.
This is an optimization based on the theory that the cluster jobs are similar.
The configuration variable <TT>NEGOTIATE_ALL_JOBS_IN_CLUSTER</TT> <A NAME="25967"></A> <A NAME="25968"></A>
disables the cluster-skipping optimization.
Use of the configuration variable <TT>SIGNIFICANT_ATTRIBUTES</TT> <A NAME="25972"></A> <A NAME="25973"></A>
will change the
definition of what the <I>condor_schedd</I> considers a cluster from the
default definition of all jobs that share the same <TT>ClusterId</TT>.

3.4.6 The Layperson's Description of the Pie Spin and Pie Slice
</H2>

<P>
Condor schedules in a variety of ways.
First, it takes all users who have submitted jobs and calculates their priority.
Then, it totals the number of resources available at the moment,
and using the ratios of the user priorities,
it calculates the number of machines each user could get.
This is their <I>pie slice</I>.

<P>
The Condor matchmaker goes in user priority order, 
contacts each user, and asks for job information. 
The <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon (on behalf of a user)
tells the matchmaker about a job,
and the matchmaker looks at available resources
to create a list of resources that match the requirements expression.
With the list of resources that match,
it sorts them according to the rank expressions within ClassAds.
If a machine prefers a job, the job is assigned to that machine,
potentially preempting a job that might already be running on that machine.
Otherwise, give the machine to the job that the job ranks highest.
If the machine ranked highest is already running a job,
we may preempt running job
for the new job. 
A default policy for preemption states that the user must
have a 20%  better priority in order for preemption to succeed.
If the job has no preferences as to what sort of machine it gets,
matchmaking gives it the first idle resource to meet its requirements.

<P>
This matchmaking cycle continues until the user has received all of the
machines in their pie slice.
The matchmaker then contacts the next highest
priority user and offers that user their pie slice worth of machines.
After contacting all users,
the cycle is repeated with any still available resources
and recomputed pie slices.

3.4.7 Group Accounting
</H2>

<P>
By default, Condor does all accounting on a per-user basis, and this
accounting is primarily used to compute priorities for Condor's
fair-share scheduling algorithms. 
However, accounting can also be done on a per-group basis.
Multiple users can all submit jobs into the same accounting group,
and all of the jobs will be treated with the same priority.

<P>
<A NAME="25801"></A>
To use an accounting group,
each job inserts an attribute into the job ClassAd which
defines the accounting group name for the job.
A common name is decided upon and used for the group.
The following line is an example that defines the attribute
within the job's submit description file:
<PRE>
+AccountingGroup = "group_physics"
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>AccountingGroup</TT> attribute is a string,
and it therefore must be enclosed in double quote marks.
The string may have a maximum length of 40 characters.
The name should <I>not</I> be qualified with a domain.
Certain parts of the Condor system 
do append the value <TT>$(UID_DOMAIN)</TT>
(as specified in the configuration file on the submit machine)
to this string for internal use.
For example, if the value of <TT>UID_DOMAIN</TT> is
<TT>example.com</TT>, and the accounting group name
is as specified,
<I>condor_userprio</I> will show statistics
for this accounting group using the appended domain, for example
<PRE>
                                    Effective
User Name                           Priority
------------------------------      ---------
group_physics@example.com                0.50
user@example.com                        23.11
heavyuser@example.com                  111.13
...
</PRE>
<P>
Additionally, the <I>condor_userprio</I> command allows administrators to
remove an entity from the accounting system in Condor.
The <B>-delete</B> option to <I>condor_userprio</I>
accomplishes this
if all the jobs from a given accounting group are completed,
and the administrator wishes to remove that group from the system.
The <B>-delete</B> option
identifies the accounting group with the fully-qualified name
of the accounting group.
For example
<PRE>
condor_userprio -delete group_physics@example.com
</PRE>
<P>
Condor removes entities itself as they are no longer
relevant.
Intervention by an administrator to delete entities can
be beneficial when the use of thousands
of short term accounting groups leads to scalability
issues.

<P>
Note that the name of an accounting group may include a period (.).
Inclusion of a period character in the accounting group name
only has relevance if the portion of the name before the
period matches a group name,
as described in the next section on group quotas.

3.4.8 Hierarchical Group Quotas
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="25819"></A>
<A NAME="25820"></A>
<A NAME="25821"></A>
The use of group quotas modifies the negotiation for 
available resources (machines) within a Condor pool.
This solves the difficulties inherent when
priorities assigned based on each single user are insufficient.
This may be the case when
different groups (of varying size) own computers,
and the groups choose to combine their computers to
form a Condor pool.
Consider an imaginary Condor pool example with thirty computers;
twenty computers are owned by the physics group and ten
computers are owned by the chemistry group.
One notion of fair allocation could be implemented 
by configuring the twenty machines owned by the physics group
to prefer (using the <TT>RANK</TT> configuration macro)
jobs submitted by the users identified as associated
with the physics group.
Likewise, the ten machines owned by the chemistry group are
configured to prefer jobs from users associated with the
the chemistry group.
This routes jobs to execute on specific machines,
perhaps causing more preemption than necessary.
The (fair allocation) policy desired is likely somewhat different,
if these thirty machines have been pooled.
The desired policy does not tie users to specific sets of machines,
but to numbers of machines (a quota).
Given thirty similar machines,
the desired policy allows users within the physics group to have
preference on up to twenty of the machines within the pool,
and the machines can be any of the machines that are available.

<P>
The implementation of quotas is hierarchical,
such that quotas may be described for groups, subgroups,
sub subgroups, etc.  
The hierarchy is described by adherence to a naming scheme
set up in advance.

<P>
A quota for a set of users requires an identification of
the set; members are called group users.
Jobs under the group quota
specify the group user with the 
<TT>AccountingGroup</TT> job ClassAd attribute.
This is the same attribute as is used with group accounting.

<P>
The submit description file syntax for specifying a job is to be
part of a group includes 
a series of names separated by the period character ('<TT>.</TT>').
Example syntax that shows only 2 levels of a (limited) hierarchy is
<PRE>
  +AccountingGroup = "&lt;group&gt;.&lt;subgroup&gt;.&lt;user&gt;"
</PRE>
Both <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;subgroup&gt;</code> are names chosen for the group.
Group names are case-insensitive for negotiation.
The topmost level group name is not required to begin with the
string <TT>"group_"</TT>,
as in the examples
<TT>"group_physics.newton"</TT> and <TT>"group_chemistry.curie"</TT>,
but it is a useful convention,
because group names must not conflict with subgroup or user names.
Note that a job specifying a value for the <TT>AccountingGroup</TT>
ClassAd attribute that lacks at least one period in the specification
will cause the job to not be considered part of a
group when negotiating, even if the group name 
(highest within the hierarchy) has a quota.
Furthermore, there will be no warnings that the group quota is not
in effect for the job, as this syntax defines group accounting.

<P>
Configuration controls the order of negotiation for
groups, subgroups within the hierarchy defined, and individual users,
as well as sets quotas
(preferentially allocated numbers of machines)
for the groups.

<P>
Quotas are categorized as either static or dynamic.
A static quota specifies an integral numbers of machines (slots),
independent of the size of the pool.
A dynamic quota specifies a percentage of machines (slots) calculated
based on the current number of machines in the pool.
It is intended that only one of a static or a dynamic quota is defined 
for a specified group.
If both are defined, then the static quota is implemented, 
and the dynamic quota is ignored.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Static Quotas</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In the hierarchical implementation,
there are two cases defined here,
to specify for the allocation of machines where
there is both a group and a subgroup.
In the first case, the sum for the numbers of machines
within all of a group's subgroups totals to fewer than the specification for
the group's static quota.
For example:
<PRE>
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_physics = 100
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_physics.experiment1 = 20
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_physics.experiment2 = 70
</PRE>
In this case, the unused quota of 10 machines is assigned to
the <TT>group_physics</TT> submitters.  

<P>
In the second case, the specification for the numbers of machines
of a set of subgroups totals to more than the specification for
the group's quota.
For example:
<PRE>
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_chemistry = 100
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_chemistry.lab1 = 40
  GROUP_QUOTA_group_chemistry.lab2 = 80
</PRE>
In this case, 
a warning is written to the log for the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon,
and each of the subgroups will have their static quota scaled.
In this example, the ratio 100/120 scales each subgroup.
<TT>lab1</TT> will have a revised (floating point) quota of 33.333 machines,
and <TT>lab2</TT> will have a revised (floating point) quota of 66.667 machines.
As numbers of machines are always integer values,
the floating point values are truncated for quota allocation.
Fractional remainders resulting from the truncation are summed
and assigned to the next higher level within the group hierarchy.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Dynamic Quotas</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A dynamic quota specifies a percentage of machines (slots) calculated
based on the quota of the next higher level group within the hierarchy.
For groups at the top level, a dynamic quota specifies a percentage of
machines (slots) that currently exist in the pool.
The quota is specified for a group (subgroup, etc.) by a floating point
value in range 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive).

<P>
Like static quota specification, there are two cases defined:
when the dynamic quotas of all sub groups of a specific group
sum to a fraction less than 1.0,
and when the dynamic quotas of all sub groups of a specific group
sum to greater than 1.0.

<P>
Here is an example configuration in which dynamic group quotas are assigned for
a single group and its subgroups.
<PRE>
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_econ = .6
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_econ.project1 = .2
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_econ.project2 = .15
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_econ.project3 = .2
</PRE>
The sum of dynamic quotas for the subgroups is .55, 
which is less than 1.0.
If the pool has 100 slots, 
then the <TT>project1</TT> subgroup is assigned a quota that
equals (100)(.6)(.2) = 12 machines. 
The <TT>project2</TT> subgroup is assigned a quota that
equals (100)(.6)(.15) = 9 machines. 
The <TT>project3</TT> subgroup is assigned a quota that
equals (100)(.6)(.2) = 12 machines. 
The 60-33=27 machines unused by the subgroups are assigned
for use by job submitters in the parent <TT>group_econ</TT> group.

<P>
If the calculated dynamic quota of the subgroups resulted in non integer
numbers of machines,
integer numbers of machines are assigned based on the truncation of the
non integer dynamic group quota.
The unused, surplus quota of machines resulting from
fractional remainders resulting from the truncation are summed
and assigned to the next higher level within the group hierarchy.

<P>
Here is another example configuration in which dynamic group quotas 
are assigned for a single group and its subgroups.
<PRE>
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_stat = .5
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_stat.project1 = .4
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_stat.project2 = .3
  GROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_group_stat.project3 = .4
</PRE>
In this case, the sum of dynamic quotas for the subgroups is 1.1, 
which is greater than 1.0 .
A warning is written to the log for the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon,
and each of the subgroups will have their dynamic group quota scaled
for this example.
.4 becomes .4/1.1=.3636,
and .3 becomes .3/1.1=.2727 .
If the pool has 100 slots, 
then each of the <TT>project1</TT> and <TT>project3</TT> subgroups 
is assigned a dynamic quota of
(100)(.5)(.3636), which is 18.1818 machines. 
The <TT>project2</TT> subgroup is assigned a dynamic quota of
(100)(.5)(.2727), which is 13.6364 machines. 
The quota for each of <TT>project1</TT> and <TT>project3</TT> results 
in the truncated amount of 18 machines,
and <TT>project2</TT> results in the truncated amount of 13 machines,
with the 0.1818 + .6364 + .1818 = 1.0 remaining machine assigned to
job submitters in the parent group, <TT>group_stat</TT>.
