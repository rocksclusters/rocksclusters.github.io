Why does the <TT>requirements</TT> expression for the job I submitted
<BR>
have extra things that I did not put in my submit description file?
</H2>
There are several extensions to the submitted <TT>requirements</TT>
that are automatically added by Condor.
Here is a list:

<UL>
<LI>Condor automatically adds <TT>arch</TT> and <TT>opsys</TT> if 
  not specified in the submit description file. It is assumed that
  the executable needs to execute on the same platform as the machine
  on which the job is submitted.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Condor automatically adds the expression
  <TT>(Memory * 1024 &gt; ImageSize)</TT>.
  This ensures that the job will run on a machine with at
  least as much physical memory as the memory footprint of the job.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Condor automatically adds the expression
  <TT>(Disk &gt;= DiskUsage)</TT> if not already specified.
  This ensures that the job will run on a machine with enough disk
  space for the job's local I/O (if there is any).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A pool administrator may define configuration variables that
  cause expressions to be added to <TT>requirements</TT>.
  These configuration variables are <TT>APPEND_REQUIREMENTS</TT>,
  <TT>APPEND_REQ_VANILLA</TT>, and <TT>APPEND_REQ_STANDARD</TT>.
  These configuration variables give
  pool administrators the flexibility to set policy for a local pool.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Older versions of Condor needed to add confusing clauses
  about WINNT and the FileSystemDomain to vanilla universe jobs.
  This made sure that the jobs ran on a machine where files were
  accessible.
  The Windows version supported automatically transferring files
  with the vanilla job,
  while the Unix version relied on a shared file system.
  Since the Unix version of Condor now supports transferring files,
  these expressions are no longer added to the
  <TT>requirements</TT> for a job.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00836000000000000000">
When I use <I>condor_compile</I> to produce a job, I get an error that says, "Internal ld was not invoked!". What does this mean?</A>
</H2>
<A NAME="47531"></A>

<P>
<I>condor_compile</I> enforces a specific behavior in the compilers and
linkers that it supports
(for example <I>gcc</I>, <I>g77</I>, <I>cc</I>, <I>CC</I>, <I>ld</I>)
where a special linker script
provided by Condor must be invoked during the final linking stages of
the supplied compiler or linker.

<P>
In some rare cases,
as with <I>gcc</I> compiled with
the options <B>-with-as</B> or <B>-with-ld</B>,
the enforcement mechanism
we rely upon to have <I>gcc</I>
choose our supplied linker script is not honored
by the compiler.
When this happens, an executable is produced,
but the executable is devoid of the
Condor libraries which both identify it as a Condor executable linked
for the standard universe and implement the feature sets of remote I/O
and transparent process checkpointing and migration.

<P>
Often, the only fix in order to use the compiler desired,
is to reconfigure and recompile the compiler itself,
such that it does not use the errant options mentioned. 

<P>
With Condor's standard universe,
we highly recommend that your source files
are compiled with the supported compiler for your platform.
See
section&nbsp;<A HREF="1_5Availability.html#sec:Availability">1.5</A>
for the list of supported compilers.
For a Linux platform, the supported compiler
is the default compiler that came with the distribution.
It is often found in the directory <TT>/usr/bin</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00837000000000000000">
Why might my job be preempted (evicted)?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are four circumstances under which Condor may evict a job.
They are controlled by different expressions.

<P>
Reason number 1 is the user priority:
controlled by the <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT>
expression in the configuration file.
If there is a job from a 
higher priority user sitting idle,
the <I>condor_negotiator</I> daemon may evict 
a currently running job submitted from a lower priority user if 
<TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT> is True.
For more on user priorities,
see section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_7Priorities_Preemption.html#sec:Priorities">2.7</A> and
section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_4User_Priorities.html#sec:UserPrio">3.4</A>.

<P>
Reason number 2 is the owner (machine) policy:
controlled by the <TT>PREEMPT</TT> expression in the configuration file.
When a job is running and the <TT>PREEMPT</TT> expression
evaluates to True,
the <I>condor_startd</I> will evict the job.
The <TT>PREEMPT</TT> expression should reflect 
the requirements under which the machine owner will not permit
a job to continue to run.
For example, a policy to evict a currently running job when a key is hit
or when it is the 9:00am work arrival time,
would be expressed in the <TT>PREEMPT</TT> expression 
and enforced by the <I>condor_startd</I>.
For more on the <TT>PREEMPT</TT> expression,
see section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_5Policy_Configuration.html#sec:Configuring-Policy">3.5</A>.

<P>
Reason number 3 is the owner (machine) preference:
controlled by the <TT>RANK</TT> expression in the 
configuration file (sometimes called the startd rank or machine rank).
The <TT>RANK</TT> expression is evaluated as a floating point number.
When one job is running, a second idle job that evaluates to a higher
<TT>RANK</TT> value 
tells the <I>condor_startd</I> to prefer the second job over the first.
Therefore, the <I>condor_startd</I> will evict the first 
job so that it can start running the second (preferred) job.
For more on <TT>RANK</TT>,
see section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_5Policy_Configuration.html#sec:Configuring-Policy">3.5</A>.

<P>
Reason number 4 is if Condor is to be shutdown:
on a machine that is currently running a job.
Condor evicts the currently running job before proceeding
with the shutdown.

Condor does not stop the Condor jobs running on my Linux machine
when I use my keyboard and mouse.  Is there a bug?
</H2>

<P>
There is no bug in Condor.
Unfortunately,
recent Linux 2.4.x and all Linux 2.6.x kernels through 
version 2.6.10
do not post proper state information,
such that Condor can detect keyboard and mouse activity.
Condor 
implements workarounds to piece together the needed
state information for PS/2 devices.
A better fix of the problem utilizes the 
kernel patch linked to from the directions posted at
<A NAME="tex2html94"
  HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/kernel.patch.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/kernel.patch.html</A>.
This patch works better for PS/2 devices, and
may also work for USB devices.
A future version of Condor will implement better recognition
of USB devices,
such that the kernel patch will also definitively work for USB devices.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00839000000000000000">
What signals get sent to my jobs when Condor needs to preempt or kill them, or when I remove them from the queue?  Can I tell Condor which signals to send?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The answer is dependent on the universe of the jobs.

<P>
Under the scheduler universe,
the signal jobs get upon <I>condor_rm</I> can be set by
the user in the submit description file with the form of
<PRE>
remove_kill_sig = SIGWHATEVER
</PRE>
If this command is not defined, 
Condor further looks for a command 
in the submit description file with the form
<PRE>
kill_sig = SIGWHATEVER
</PRE>
And, if that command is also not given,
Condor uses SIGTERM.

<P>
For all other universes, the jobs get the value of
the submit description file command
<code>kill_sig</code>, which is SIGTERM by default.

<P>
If a job is killed or evicted, the job is sent a
<code>kill_sig</code>, 
unless it is on the receiving end of a hard kill,
in which case it gets SIGKILL.

<P>
Under all universes,
the signal is sent only to the parent PID of the job,
namely, the first child of the <I>condor_starter</I>.
If the child itself is forking,
the child must catch and forward signals as appropriate.
This in turn depends on the user's desired behavior.
The exception to this is (again) where the job is receiving
a hard kill.
Condor sends the value SIGKILL to all the PIDs in the family.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION008310000000000000000">
Why does my Linux job have an enormous ImageSize and
refuse to run anymore?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="47194"></A>
<A NAME="47195"></A>

<P>
Sometimes Linux jobs run, are preempted and can not start again because
Condor thinks the image size of the job is too big. This is because
Condor has a problem calculating the image size of a program on Linux
that uses threads. It is particularly noticeable in the Java universe,
but it also happens in the vanilla universe. It is not an issue in the
standard universe, because threaded programs are not allowed.

<P>
On Linux, each thread appears to consume as much memory as the entire
program consumes, so the image size appears to be (number-of-threads *
image-size-of-program). If your program uses a lot of threads, your
apparent image size balloons. You can see the image size that Condor
believes your program has by using the -l option to condor_q, and
looking at the ImageSize attribute.

<P>
When you submit your job, Condor creates or extends the requirements
for your job. In particular, it adds a requirement that you job must
run on a machine with sufficient memory:

<P>
<PRE>
Requirements = ... ((Memory * 1024) &gt;= ImageSize) ...
</PRE>
<P>
(Note that memory is the execution machine's memory in megabytes while
ImageSize is in kilobytes). When your application is threaded, the
image size appears to be much larger than it really is, and you may not
have a machine with sufficient memory to handle this requirement.

<P>
Unfortunately, calculating the correct ImageSize is rather hard to fix
on Linux, and we do not yet have a good solution. Fortunately, there
is a workaround while we work on a good solution for a future
release.

<P>
In the Requirements expression above, Condor added <TT>(Memory * 1024) &gt;=
ImageSize)</TT> on your behalf. You can prevent Condor from doing this by
giving it your own expression about memory in your submit file, just
as:

<P>
<PRE>
Requirements = Memory &gt; 1024
</PRE>

<P>
You will need to change 1024 to a reasonably good estimate of the actual
image size of your program, in kilobytes. This expression says that
your program requires 1 megabyte of memory. If you underestimate the
memory your application needs, you may have bad performance if you job
runs on machines that have insufficient memory.

<P>
In addition, if you have modified your machine policies to preempt
jobs when they get big a ImageSize, you will need to change those
policies.

Why does the time output from <I>condor_status</I> appear
as [?????] ? 
</H2>

<P>
Condor collects timing information for a large variety of uses.
Collection of the data relies on accurate times.
Being a distributed system, clock skew among machines causes 
errant timing calculations.
Values can be reported too large or too small, with the possibility
of calculating negative timing values.

<P>
This problem may be seen by the user when looking at the output
of <I>condor_status</I>.
If the <B>ActivityTime</B> field appears
as [?????],
then this calculated statistic was negative.
<I>condor_status</I> recognizes that a negative amount of time will
be nonsense to report, and instead displays this string. 

<P>
The solution to the problem is to synchronize the clocks on
these machines.
An administrator can do this using a tool such as <I>ntp</I>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION008312000000000000000">
The user condor's home directory cannot be found.  Why?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="47210"></A>
<A NAME="47211"></A>
This problem may be observed after installation, when attempting
to execute
<PRE>
~condor/condor/bin/condor_config_val  -tilde
</PRE>and there is a user named condor.
The command prints a message such as
<PRE>
     Error: Specified -tilde but can't find condor's home directory
</PRE>
<P>
In this case, the difficulty stems from 
using NIS,
because the Condor daemons fail to communicate properly with NIS to get
account information.
To fix the problem, a dynamically linked version of Condor must
be installed.

Condor commands (including <I>condor_q</I>) are really slow. What is going on?
</H2>

<P>
Some Condor programs will react slowly if they expect to find a
<I>condor_collector</I> daemon, yet cannot contact one.
Notably, <I>condor_q</I> can be very slow.
The <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon will also be slow,
and it will log lots of harmless messages complaining.
If you are not running a <I>condor_collector</I> daemon,
it is important that the configuration variable
<TT>COLLECTOR_HOST</TT> <A NAME="47683"></A> <A NAME="47684"></A> be set to nothing.
This is typically done by setting <TT>CONDOR_HOST</TT> with
<PRE>
CONDOR_HOST=
COLLECTOR_HOST=$(CONDOR_HOST)

<PRE>
COLLECTOR_HOST=

The transfer does take place whenever a job is

<LI>If using file transfer
(the submit description file contains
<B>vmware_should_transfer_files = true</B>),
then modify any
configuration variable <TT>EXECUTE</TT> <A NAME="47693"></A> <A NAME="47694"></A> values on all execute machines,
such that they do not contain symbolic link path components.
</LI>
<LI>If using a shared file system, ensure that the
submit description file command
<B>vmware_dir</B> does not use
symbolic link path name components.
</LI>
</UL>
