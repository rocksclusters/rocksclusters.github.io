Description</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>condor_submit</I> is the program for submitting jobs for execution
under Condor.
<I>condor_submit</I> requires a submit description file which contains commands
to direct the queuing of jobs.
One submit description file may contain
specifications for the queuing of many Condor jobs at once.
A single invocation of <I>condor_submit</I> may cause one or
more clusters.
A cluster is a set of jobs
specified in the submit description file
between <B>queue</B> commands for which the executable is not changed.
It is advantageous to submit
multiple jobs as a single cluster because:

<UL>
<LI>Only one copy of the checkpoint file is needed to 
represent all jobs in a cluster until they begin execution.
</LI>
<LI>There is much less overhead involved for Condor to start the next
job in a cluster than for Condor to start a new cluster.  This can make
a big difference when submitting lots of short jobs.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Multiple clusters may be specified within a single
submit description file.
Each cluster must specify a single executable.

<P>
The job ClassAd attribute <TT>ClusterId</TT> identifies a cluster.
See specifics for this attribute
in the Appendix on page&nbsp;<A HREF="10_Appendix_A.html#sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
Note that submission of jobs from a Windows machine requires
a stashed password to allow Condor to impersonate the user submitting
the job.
To stash a password, use the <I>condor_store_cred</I> command.
See the manual page at
page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_store_cred.html#man-condor-store-cred"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for details.

<P>
For lengthy lines within the submit description file,
the backslash (<!-- MATH
 $\mathtt{\backslash}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$\mathtt{\backslash}$">) is a line continuation character.
Placing the backslash at the end of a line causes the current line's command
to be continued with the next line of the file.
Submit description files may contain comments.
A comment is any line beginning with a pound character (<code>#</code>). 

<P>
Here is a list of
the commands that may be placed in the submit description file
to direct the submission of a job.

Submit Description File Commands
</H2>
Each submit description file describes one cluster of jobs to be
placed in the Condor execution pool. All jobs in a cluster must share
the same executable, but they may have different input and output files,
and different program arguments. The submit description file is
the only command-line argument to <I>condor_submit</I>. If the submit description
file argument is omitted, <I>condor_submit</I> will read the submit description
from standard input.

<P>
The submit description file must contain 
one <I>executable</I> command and at least one <I>queue</I> command.
All of the other commands have default actions.

<P>
The commands which can appear in the submit description file are
numerous.  They are listed here in alphabetical order by category.

<P>
<I>BASIC COMMANDS</I>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<A NAME="72517"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>arguments = &lt;argument_list&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="man-condor-submit-arguments"></A>List of arguments to be supplied
to the program on the command line.   In the Java Universe, the first
argument must be the name of the class containing <TT>main</TT>.

<P>
There are two permissible formats for specifying arguments.  The new
syntax supports uniform quoting of spaces within arguments; the old
syntax supports spaces in arguments only in special circumstances.

<P>
In the old syntax, arguments are delimited (separated) by space
characters.  Double-quotes must be escaped with a backslash (i.e. put
a backslash in front of each double-quote).

<P>
Further interpretation of the argument string differs depending on the
operating system.  On Windows, your argument string is
simply passed verbatim (other than the backslash in front of
double-quotes) to the Windows application.  Most Windows applications
will allow you to put spaces within an argument value by surrounding
the argument with double-quotes.
In all
other cases, there is no further interpretation of the arguments.

<P>
Example:

<P>
<PRE>
arguments = one \"two\" 'three'
</PRE>

<P>
Produces in Unix vanilla universe:

<P>
<PRE>
argument 1: one
argument 2: "two"
argument 3: 'three'
</PRE>

<P>
Here are the rules for using the new syntax:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Put double quotes around the entire argument string.  This
distinguishes the new syntax from the old, because these double-quotes
are not escaped with backslashes, as required in the old syntax.  Any
literal double-quotes within the string must be escaped by repeating
them.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use white space (e.g. spaces or tabs) to separate arguments.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To put any white space in an argument, you must surround the
space and as much of the surrounding argument as you like with
single-quotes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To insert a literal single-quote, you must repeat it anywhere
inside of a single-quoted section.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Example:

<P>
<PRE>
arguments = "one ""two"" 'spacey ''quoted'' argument'"
</PRE>

<P>
Produces:

<P>
<PRE>
argument 1: one
argument 2: "two"
argument 3: spacey 'quoted' argument
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that in the new syntax, backslash has no special meaning.  This
is for the convenience of Windows users.

<P>
<A NAME="72530"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>environment = &lt;parameter_list&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>List of environment
<A NAME="72531"></A>
<A NAME="man-condor-submit-environment"></A>variables.

<P>
There are two different formats for specifying the environment
variables: the old format and the new format.  The old format is
retained for backward-compatibility.  It suffers from a
platform-dependent syntax and the inability to insert some special
characters into the environment.

<P>
The new syntax for specifying environment values:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Put double quote marks around the entire argument string.  This
distinguishes the new syntax from the old.
The old syntax does not have double quote marks around it.
Any literal double quote marks within the string
must be escaped by repeating the double quote mark.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Each environment entry has the form

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use white space (space or tab characters) to separate environment entries.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To put any white space in an environment entry, surround
the space and as much of the surrounding entry as desired with
single quote marks.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To insert a literal single quote mark, repeat the single quote mark
anywhere inside of a section surrounded by single quote marks.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Example:

<P>
<PRE>
environment = "one=1 two=""2"" three='spacey ''quoted'' value'"
</PRE>

<P>
Produces the following environment entries:

<P>
<PRE>
one=1
two="2"
three=spacey 'quoted' value
</PRE>

<P>
Under the old syntax, there are no double quote marks surrounding the
environment specification.  Each environment entry remains of the form
<PRE>
&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
</PRE>
Under Unix, list multiple environment entries by separating them with
a semicolon (;).  Under Windows, separate multiple entries with a
vertical bar (| ).  There is no way to insert a literal semicolon
under Unix or a literal vertical bar under Windows.  Note that spaces
are accepted, but rarely desired, characters within parameter names
and values, because they are treated as literal characters, not
separators or ignored white space.  Place spaces within the parameter
list only if required.

<P>
A Unix example:

<P>
<PRE>
environment = one=1;two=2;three="quotes have no 'special' meaning"
</PRE>

<P>
This produces the following:

<P>
<PRE>
one=1
two=2
three="quotes have no 'special' meaning"
</PRE>

<P>
If the environment is set with the <B>environment</B> command <I>and</I>
<B>getenv</B> is also set to true, values specified with
<B>environment</B> override values in the submittor's environment
(regardless of the order of the <B>environment</B> and <B>getenv</B>
commands).

<P>
<A NAME="72553"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>error = &lt;pathname&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A path and file name used by Condor to capture any
error messages the program would normally write to the screen
(that is, this file becomes <TT>stderr</TT>).
A path is given with respect to the file system of the machine
on which the job is submitted.
The file is written (by the job)
in the remote scratch directory of the machine where the job is executed. 
When the job exits, the resulting file is transferred back to the machine
where the job was submitted, and the path is utilized for file placement.
If not specified, the default value of
<TT>/dev/null</TT> is used for submission to a Unix machine.
If not specified, error messages are ignored
for submission to a Windows machine.
More than one job should not use the same error file, since
this will cause one job to overwrite the errors of another.
The error file and the output file should not be the same file
as the outputs will overwrite each other or be lost.
For grid universe jobs, <B>error</B> may be a URL that the Globus
tool <I>globus_url_copy</I> understands.

<P>
<A NAME="72558"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>executable = &lt;pathname&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An optional path and a required file name of the executable file for this
job cluster. Only one <B>executable</B> command within a
submit description file is guaranteed to work properly.
More than one often works.

<P>
If no path or a relative path is used, then the executable file
is presumed to be relative
to the current working directory of the user as the
<I>condor_submit</I> command is issued.

<P>
If submitting into the standard universe, then the named executable
must have been re-linked with the Condor libraries (such as via the
<I>condor_compile</I> command). If submitting into the vanilla universe
(the default), then the named executable need not be re-linked and can
be any process which can run in the background (shell scripts work
fine as well).  If submitting into the Java universe, then the
argument must be a compiled <TT>.class</TT> file.

<P>
<A NAME="72563"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>getenv = &lt;True |  False&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If <B>getenv</B> is set to
<A NAME="72565"></A>
<TT>True</TT>, then <I>condor_submit</I> will copy all of the user's current
shell environment variables at the time of job submission into the job
ClassAd. The job will therefore execute with the same set of environment
variables that the user had at submit time. Defaults to <TT>False</TT>.

<P>
If the environment is set with the <B>environment</B> command <I>and</I>
<B>getenv</B> is also set to true, values specified with
<B>environment</B> override values in the submittor's environment
(regardless of the order of the <B>environment</B> and <B>getenv</B>
commands).

<P>
<A NAME="72575"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>input = &lt;pathname&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Condor assumes that its jobs are
long-running, and that the user will not wait at the terminal for their
completion. Because of this, the standard files which normally access
the terminal, (<TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>, and <TT>stderr</TT>),
must refer to files. Thus,
the file name specified with <B>input</B> should contain any keyboard
input the program requires (that is, this file becomes <TT>stdin</TT>).
A path is given with respect to the file system of the machine
on which the job is submitted.
The file is transferred before execution
to the remote scratch directory of the machine where the job is executed. 
If not specified, the default value
of <TT>/dev/null</TT> is used for submission to a Unix machine.
If not specified, input is ignored
for submission to a Windows machine.
For grid universe jobs, <B>input</B> may be a URL that the Globus
tool <I>globus_url_copy</I> understands.

<P>
Note that this command does <I>not</I> refer to the command-line
arguments of the program.  The command-line arguments are specified by
the <B>arguments</B> command.

<P>
<A NAME="72586"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>log = &lt;pathname&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Use <B>log</B> to specify a file name where
Condor will write a log file of what is happening with this job cluster.
For example, Condor will place a log entry into this file
when and where the job begins running,
when the job produces a checkpoint, or moves (migrates) to another machine,
and when the job completes.
Most users find specifying a <B>log</B> file to be handy;
its use is recommended. If no <B>log</B> entry is specified, 
Condor does not create a log for this cluster.

<P>
<A NAME="72590"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>log_xml = &lt;True |  False&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If <B>log_xml</B> is <TT>True</TT>, 
then the log file will be written in ClassAd XML.
If not specified, XML is not used.
Note that the file is an XML fragment; it is
missing the file header and footer.
Do not mix XML and non-XML within a single file.
If multiple jobs write to a
single log file, ensure that all of the jobs specify
this option in the same way.

<P>
<A NAME="man-condor-submit-notification"></A></DD>
<DT><STRONG>notification = &lt;Always |  Complete |  Error |  Never&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="72594"></A>
Owners of Condor jobs are notified by
e-mail when certain events occur.
If defined by <I>Always</I>, the owner will be notified
whenever the job produces a checkpoint, as well as when the job completes.
If defined by <I>Complete</I> (the default), the owner will
be notified when the job terminates.
If defined by <I>Error</I>, the owner will only be notified
if the job terminates abnormally.
If defined by <I>Never</I>, the owner will not receive e-mail,
regardless to what happens to the job.
The statistics included in the e-mail are documented in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_6Managing_Job.html#sec:job-completion">2.6.7</A> on

<DD><A NAME="man-condor-submit-notify-user"></A>Used to specify the e-mail
address to use when Condor sends e-mail about a job.  If not specified,
Condor defaults to using the e-mail address defined by

</PRE>
where the configuration variable <TT>UID_DOMAIN</TT> <A NAME="73397"></A> <A NAME="73398"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="72609"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>output = &lt;pathname&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A NAME="man-condor-submit-output"></A>The <B>output</B> file captures
any information the program would ordinarily write to the screen
(that is, this file becomes <TT>stdout</TT>).
A path is given with respect to the file system of the machine
on which the job is submitted.
The file is written (by the job)
in the remote scratch directory of the machine where the job is executed. 
When the job exits, the resulting file is transferred back to the machine
where the job was submitted, and the path is utilized for file placement.
If not specified, the default value of
<TT>/dev/null</TT> is used for submission to a Unix machine.
If not specified, output is ignored
for submission to a Windows machine.
Multiple jobs should not use the same output
file, since this will cause one job to overwrite the output of
another.
The output file and the error file should not be the same file
as the outputs will overwrite each other or be lost.

<DT><STRONG>rank = &lt;ClassAd Float Expression&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A ClassAd Floating-Point
expression that states how to rank machines which have already met the requirements
expression. Essentially, rank expresses preference.  A higher numeric value
equals better rank. Condor will give the job the machine with the
highest rank.  For example,
<PRE>
        requirements = Memory &gt; 60
        rank = Memory
</PRE>
asks Condor to find all available machines with more than 60 megabytes of memory
and give to the job the machine with the most amount of memory.
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_5Submitting_Job.html#sec:user-man-req-and-rank">2.5.2</A>

<A NAME="72651"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>requirements = &lt;ClassAd Boolean Expression&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The requirements
command is a boolean ClassAd expression which uses C-like operators. In
order for any job in this cluster to run on a given machine, this
requirements expression must evaluate to true on the given machine. For
example, to require that whatever machine executes a Condor job has a
least 64 Meg of RAM and has a MIPS performance rating greater than 45,
use:
<PRE>
requirements = Memory &gt;= 64 &amp;&amp; Mips &gt; 45
</PRE>
For scheduler and local universe jobs, the requirements expression is
evaluated against
the <TT>Scheduler</TT> ClassAd which represents the 
the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon running on the submit machine,
rather than a remote machine.
Like all commands in the submit description file, if multiple requirements
commands are present, all but the last one are ignored.
By default, <I>condor_submit</I> appends the following clauses to
the requirements expression:

<OL>
<LI>Arch and OpSys are set equal to the Arch and OpSys of the
submit machine.  In other words: unless you request otherwise, Condor will give your
job machines with the same architecture and operating system version as
the machine running <I>condor_submit</I>.
</LI>
<LI>Disk &gt;= DiskUsage.
The <TT>DiskUsage</TT> attribute is initialized to the size of the
executable plus the size of any files specified in a
<B>transfer_input_files</B> command.
It exists to ensure there is enough disk space on the
target machine for Condor to copy over both the executable
and needed input files.
The <TT>DiskUsage</TT> attribute represents the maximum amount of
total disk space required by the job in kilobytes.
Condor automatically updates the <TT>DiskUsage</TT> attribute
approximately every 20 minutes while the job runs with the
amount of space being used by the job on the execute machine.
</LI>
<LI>(Memory * 1024) &gt;= ImageSize.  To ensure the target machine
has enough memory to run your job.
</LI>
<LI>If Universe is set to Vanilla, FileSystemDomain is set equal to
the submit machine's FileSystemDomain.

<DD><A NAME="72671"></A>
The <B>should_transfer_files</B> setting is used to define if Condor
should transfer files to and from the remote machine where the job
runs.
The file transfer mechanism is used to run jobs which are not in the
standard universe (and can therefore use remote system calls for file
access) on machines which do not have a shared file system with the
submit machine.
<B>should_transfer_files</B> equal to <I>YES</I> will cause Condor to
always transfer files for the job.
<I>NO</I> disables Condor's file transfer mechanism.
<I>IF_NEEDED</I> will not transfer files for the job if it is matched
with a resource in the same <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> as the submit
machine (and therefore, on a machine with the same shared file
system).
If the job is matched with a remote resource in a different 
<TT>FileSystemDomain</TT>, Condor will transfer the necessary files.

<DT><STRONG>transfer_output_files = &lt; file1,file2,file... &gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This command forms an explicit list of output files to be transferred
back from the temporary working directory on the execute machine to
the submit machine.
Most of the time, there is no need to use this command.
For grid universe jobs, other than where the grid type is <B>condor</B>,
the use of <B>transfer_output_files</B> is useful.
For Condor-C jobs and all other non-grid universe jobs,
if <B>transfer_output_files</B> is not specified,
Condor will automatically transfer back all files in the job's
temporary working directory which have been
modified or created by the job.
This is usually the desired behavior.
Explicitly listing output files is typically only done when the job creates
many files, and the user wants to keep a subset of
those files.
If there are multiple files, they must be delimited with commas.
<U>WARNING</U>: Do not specify <B>transfer_output_files</B> in the
submit description file unless there is a really good reason - it is
best to let Condor figure things out by itself based upon what
the job produces.

<P>
For grid universe jobs other than with grid type <B>condor</B>,
to have files other than standard output and standard error transferred
from the execute machine back to the submit machine,
do use <B>transfer_output_files</B>, listing
all files to be transferred.
These files are found on the execute machine in the
working directory of the job.

<P>

<DT><STRONG>transfer_output_remaps = &lt; `` name = newname ; name2 = newname2 ... ''&gt; </STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies the name (and optionally path) to use when downloading output
files from the completed job.  Normally, output files are transferred back
to the initial working directory with the same name they had in the execution

or name.  If you specify a relative path, the final path will be relative
to the job's initial working directory.

<P>
<I>name</I> describes an output file name produced by your job, and
<I>newname</I> describes the file name it should be downloaded to.
Multiple remaps can be specified by separating each with a semicolon.

<P>
The <I>ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT</I> option is intended for fault tolerant
jobs which periodically save their own state and can restart where
they left off.
In this case, files are spooled to the submit machine any time the
job leaves a remote site, either because it exited on its own, or was
evicted by the Condor system for any reason prior to job completion.
The files spooled back are placed in a directory defined by
the value of the <TT>SPOOL</TT> configuration variable.
Any output files transferred back to the submit machine are
automatically sent back out again as input files if the job restarts.

<B>leave_in_queue</B> defaults to <TT>False</TT>.

For example:
Suppose a job is known to run for a minimum of an hour.
If the job exits after less than an hour, the job should be placed on

<DT><STRONG>on_exit_remove = &lt;ClassAd Boolean Expression&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ClassAd expression is checked when the job exits, and if <TT>True</TT>
(the default value when undefined),
then it allows the job to leave the queue normally.
If <TT>False</TT>, then the job is placed back into the Idle state.
If the user job runs under the vanilla universe,
then the job restarts from the beginning.
If the user job runs under the standard universe,
then it continues from where it left off, using the last checkpoint.

<P>
For example,
suppose a job occasionally segfaults,
but chances are that the job will finish successfully
if the job is run again with the same data.
The <B>on_exit_remove</B> expression can cause the job
to run again with the following command.
Assume that the signal identifier for the segmentation fault is 11 on the
platform where the job will be running.
<PRE>
  on_exit_remove = (ExitBySignal == False) || (ExitSignal != 11)
</PRE>This expression lets the job leave the queue if the job was
not killed by a signal or if it was
killed by a signal other than 11, representing segmentation fault in
this example.
So, if the exited due to signal 11, it will stay in the job queue.
In any other case of the job exiting,
the job will leave the queue as it normally would have done.

<P>
As another example,
if the job should only leave the queue if it exited on its own with
status 0,
this <B>on_exit_remove</B> expression works well:

<P>
<PRE>
  on_exit_remove = (ExitBySignal == False) &amp;&amp; (ExitCode == 0)

If a job is evicted from one or more machines during the course of its
lifetime, such an output file might contain several copies of the results.
This option should be only be used when you wish a certain file to be
treated as a running log instead of a precise result.

<DT><STRONG>buffer_block_size = &lt;bytes-in-block&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Condor keeps a buffer of recently-used data for each file a job accesses.
This buffer is used both to cache commonly-used data and to consolidate small
reads and writes into larger operations that get better throughput.
The default settings should produce reasonable results for most programs.

<P>
These options only apply to standard-universe jobs.

<P>
If needed, you may set the buffer controls individually for each file using
the buffer_files option. For example, to set the buffer size to 1 Mbyte and
the block size to 256 Kbytes for the file <TT>input.data</TT>, use this command:

<P>
<PRE>
buffer_files = "input.data=(1000000,256000)"
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you may use these two options to set
the default sizes for all files used by your job:

<P>
<PRE>
buffer_size = 1000000
buffer_block_size = 256000
</PRE>

<P>
If you do not set these, Condor will use the values given by these
two configuration file macros:

<P>
<PRE>
DEFAULT_IO_BUFFER_SIZE = 1000000
DEFAULT_IO_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE = 256000
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, if no other settings are present, Condor will use
a buffer of 512 Kbytes
and a block size of 32 Kbytes.

<DT><STRONG>compress_files = file1, file2, ...</STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>
If your job attempts to access any of the files mentioned in this list,
Condor will automatically compress them (if writing) or decompress them (if reading).
The compress format is the same as used by GNU gzip.

<P>
The files given in this list may be simple file names or complete paths and may
include * as a wild card.  For example, this list causes the file /tmp/data.gz,
any file named event.gz, and any file ending in .gzip to be automatically
compressed or decompressed as needed:

<P>
<PRE>
compress_files = /tmp/data.gz, event.gz, *.gzip
</PRE>
Due to the nature of the compression format, compressed files must only
be accessed sequentially.  Random access reading is allowed but is very slow,
while random access writing is simply not possible.  This restriction may be
avoided by using both compress_files and fetch_files at the same time.  When
this is done, a file is kept in the decompressed state at the execution
machine, but is compressed for transfer to its original location.

This option only applies to standard universe jobs.

<DD>If your job attempts to access a file mentioned in this list,

it will be copied back to its original location.

describes a file name that your job may attempt to open, and <I>newname</I>
describes the file name it should be replaced with.
<I>newname</I> may include an optional leading
access specifier, <code>local:</code> or <code>remote:</code>.  If left unspecified,
the default access specifier is <code>remote:</code>.  Multiple remaps can be
specified by separating each with a semicolon.

these special characters may be escaped with a backslash.

<DT><STRONG>Example Two:</STRONG></DT>

called <TT>very.big</TT>.
If this file can be found in the same place on
a local disk in every machine in the pool,
(say <TT>/bigdisk/bigfile</TT>,) you can
instruct Condor of this fact by remapping <TT>very.big</TT> to
<TT>/bigdisk/bigfile</TT> and specifying that the file is to be read locally,
which will be much faster than reading over the network.
<PRE>
file_remaps = "very.big = local:/bigdisk/bigfile"

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Example Three:</STRONG></DT>

<DT><STRONG>want_remote_io = &lt;True |  False&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option controls how a file is opened and manipulated in a standard
universe job.
If this option is true, which is the default, then the <I>condor_shadow</I>
makes all decisions about how each and every file should be opened by
the executing job.
This entails a network round trip (or more) from the job to the
<I>condor_shadow</I> and back again for every single <TT>open()</TT>
in addition to other needed information about the file.
If set to false, then when the job queries the <I>condor_shadow</I> for the
first time about how to open a file, the <I>condor_shadow</I> will inform the
job to automatically perform all of its file manipulation on the local
file system on the execute machine and any file remapping will be ignored.
This means that there <B>must</B> be a shared file system (such
as NFS or AFS) between the execute machine and the submit machine and that
<B>ALL</B> paths that the job could open on the execute machine must be valid.
The ability of the standard universe job to checkpoint, possibly to a
checkpoint server, is not affected by this attribute.
However, when the job resumes it will be expecting the same file system
conditions that were present when the job checkpointed.

Deferral time is evaluated with respect to the execution machine.
This option delays the start of
execution, but not the matching and claiming of

<DT><STRONG>image_size = &lt;size&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This command tells Condor the maximum
virtual image size to which you believe your program will grow during
its execution. Condor will then execute your job only on machines which
have enough resources, (such as virtual memory), to support executing
your job. If you do not specify the image size of your job in the
description file, Condor will automatically make a (reasonably accurate)
estimate about its size and adjust this estimate as your program runs.
If the image size of your job is underestimated, it may crash due to
inability to acquire more address space, e.g. malloc() fails. If the image
size is overestimated, Condor may have difficulty finding machines which
have the required resources. <I>size</I> must be in Kbytes, e.g. for
an image size of 8 megabytes, use a <I>size</I> of 8000.

<DT><STRONG>max_job_retirement_time = &lt;integer expression&gt;</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An integer-valued expression (in seconds) that
does nothing unless the machine that runs the job has been configured
to provide retirement time
(see section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_5Policy_Configuration.html#sec:State-Expression-Summary">3.5.8</A>).
Retirement time is a
grace period given to a job to finish naturally
when a resource claim is about to be preempted.
No kill signals are sent during a retirement time.
The default behavior in many cases is to take as much
retirement time as the machine offers,
so this command will rarely appear in a submit description file.

<P>
When a resource claim is to be preempted, this expression in the
submit file specifies the maximum run time of the job (in seconds, since
the job started).
This expression has no effect,
if it is greater than the maximum retirement time provided
by the machine policy.
If the resource claim is <I>not</I> preempted,
this expression and the machine retirement policy are irrelevant. 
If the resource claim <I>is</I> preempted
and the job finishes sooner than the maximum time,
the claim closes gracefully and all is well.
If the resource claim is preempted
and the job does <I>not</I> finish in time,
the usual preemption
procedure is followed (typically a soft kill signal, followed by some
time to gracefully shut down, followed by a hard kill signal).

<P>
Standard universe jobs and any jobs running with <B>nice_user</B>
priority have a default <B>max_job_retirement_time</B> of 0,
so no retirement time is utilized by default.
In all other cases,
no default value is provided,
so the maximum amount of retirement time is utilized by default.

<P>
Setting this expression does not affect the job's resource
requirements or preferences.

a machine with a minimum ,

specify this in the requirements and/or rank expressions.

In addition to commands, the submit description file can contain macros
and comments:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Macros</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Parameterless macros in the form of <TT>$(macro_name)</TT>
may be inserted anywhere in Condor submit description files. Macros can be
defined by lines in the form of 
<PRE> 
        &lt;macro_name&gt; = &lt;string&gt;
</PRE> 
Three pre-defined macros are supplied by the submit description file parser.
The third of the pre-defined macros is only relevant to MPI applications
under the parallel universe.
The
<TT>$(Cluster)</TT><A NAME="73858"></A><A NAME="73859"></A> macro supplies the value of the
<A NAME="73242"></A>
<A NAME="73243"></A>
<A NAME="73244"></A>
<TT>ClusterId</TT> job
ClassAd attribute, and the
<TT>$(Process)</TT><A NAME="73864"></A><A NAME="73865"></A> macro supplies the value of the
<TT>ProcId</TT> job
ClassAd attribute.
These macros are
intended to aid in the specification of input/output files, arguments,
etc., for clusters with lots of jobs, and/or could be used to supply a
Condor process with its own cluster and process numbers on the command
line.
The 
<TT>$(Node)</TT><A NAME="73870"></A><A NAME="73871"></A> macro is defined for MPI applications run
as parallel universe jobs.
It is a unique value assigned for the duration of the job
that essentially identifies the machine on which a program is
executing.

<P>
<A NAME="73249"></A>
To use the dollar sign character (<code>$</code>) as a literal,
without macro expansion, use
<PRE>
$(DOLLAR)
</PRE>

<P>
In addition to the normal macro, there is also a special kind of macro
called a <I>substitution macro</I>
<A NAME="73253"></A>
that allows the substitution of
a ClassAd attribute value defined on the resource machine itself
(gotten after a match to the machine has been made)
into specific commands within the
submit description file. The substitution macro is of the form:
<PRE> 
$$(attribute)
</PRE>

<P>
A common use of this macro is for the heterogeneous
submission of an executable:
<PRE>
executable = povray.$$(opsys).$$(arch)
</PRE>
Values for the <TT>opsys</TT> and <TT>arch</TT> attributes are substituted at
match time for any given resource. This allows Condor to automatically
choose the correct executable for the matched machine.

<P>
An extension to the syntax of the substitution macro provides an
alternative string to use if the machine attribute within the
substitution macro is undefined.
The syntax appears as:
<PRE> 
$$(attribute:string_if_attribute_undefined)
</PRE>

<P>
An example using this extended syntax provides a path name to a
required input file.
Since the file can be placed in different locations on
different machines, the file's path name is given as an argument
to the program.
<PRE> 
argument = $$(input_file_path:/usr/foo)
</PRE>
On the machine, if the attribute <TT>input_file_path</TT> is not
defined, then the path <TT>/usr/foo</TT> is used instead.

<P>
A further extension to the syntax of the substitution macro allows the
evaluation of a ClassAd expression to define the value.
As all substitution macros, the expression is evaluated after
a match has been made.
Therefore, the expression may refer to machine attributes
by prefacing them with the scope resolution prefix <TT>TARGET.</TT>,
as specified in section&nbsp;<A HREF="4_1Condor_s_ClassAd.html#ClassAd:evaluation">4.1.2</A>.
To place a ClassAd expression into the substitution macro,
square brackets are added to delimit the expression.
The syntax appears as:
<PRE> 
$$([ClassAd expression])
</PRE>
An example of a job that uses this syntax may be one that
wants to know how much memory it can use. 
The application cannot detect this itself, as it would potentially use
all of the memory on a multi-slot machine.
So the job determines the memory per slot, 
reducing it by 10% to account for miscellaneous overhead,
and passes this as a command line argument to the application.
In the submit description file will be
<PRE> 
arguments=--memory $$([TARGET.Memory * 0.9])
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="73272"></A>
To insert two dollar sign characters (<code>$$</code>) as literals
into a ClassAd string, use
<PRE>
$$(DOLLARDOLLAR)
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="73275"></A>
<A NAME="73276"></A>
<A NAME="73277"></A>
The environment macro, $ENV, allows the evaluation of an environment
variable to be used in setting a submit description file command.
The syntax used is
<PRE> 
$ENV(variable)
</PRE>
An example submit description file command that uses this functionality
evaluates the submittor's home directory in order to set the
path and file name of a log file:
<PRE> 
log = $ENV(HOME)/jobs/logfile
</PRE>
The environment variable is evaluated when the submit description
file is processed.

<P>
<A NAME="73282"></A>
<A NAME="73283"></A>
<A NAME="73284"></A>
The $RANDOM_CHOICE macro allows a random choice to be made
from a given list of parameters at submission time.
For an expression, if some randomness needs to be generated,
the macro may appear as
<PRE> 
    $RANDOM_CHOICE(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
</PRE>
When evaluated, one of the parameters values will be chosen. 

<P>

pound sign
('#')
character are ignored by the submit description file parser.

General Remarks</A>
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>For security reasons, Condor will refuse to run any jobs submitted
by user root (UID = 0) or by a user whose default group is group wheel
(GID = 0). Jobs submitted by user root or a user with a default group of
wheel will appear to sit forever in the queue in an idle state. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All path names specified in the submit description file must be
less than 256 characters in length, and command line arguments must be
less than 4096 characters in length; otherwise, <I>condor_submit</I> gives a
warning message but the jobs will not execute properly. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Somewhat understandably, behavior gets bizarre if the user makes
the mistake of requesting multiple Condor jobs to write to the
same file, and/or if the user alters any files that need to be accessed
by a Condor job which is still in the queue.
For example, the compressing of data or
output files before a Condor job has completed is a common mistake.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To disable checkpointing for Standard Universe jobs, include the
line:
<PRE>
      +WantCheckpoint = False
</PRE>
in the submit description file before the queue command(s).
