<A NAME="47447"></A>
<BR>
If I see <TT>PERMISSION DENIED</TT> in my log files,
what does that mean?
</H2>

<P>
Most likely, the Condor installation has been misconfigured
and Condor's access control security functionality is preventing
daemons and tools from communicating with each other.
Other symptoms of this problem include Condor tools (such as
<I>condor_status</I> and <I>condor_q</I>) not producing any output, or commands
that appear to have no effect (for example, <I>condor_off</I> or
<I>condor_on</I>). 

<P>
The solution is to properly configure the <TT>HOSTALLOW_*</TT> <A NAME="47793"></A> <A NAME="47794"></A> and
<TT>HOSTDENY_*</TT> <A NAME="47798"></A> <A NAME="47799"></A> settings (for host/IP based authentication) or to
configure strong authentication and set <TT>ALLOW_*</TT> <A NAME="47803"></A> <A NAME="47804"></A> and
<TT>DENY_*</TT> <A NAME="47808"></A> <A NAME="47809"></A> as appropriate.
Host-based authentication is described in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_6Security.html#sec:Host-Security">3.6.9</A> on page&nbsp;<A HREF="3_6Security.html#sec:Host-Security"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.
Information about other forms of authentication is provided in 
section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_6Security.html#sec:Config-Security">3.6.1</A> on page&nbsp;<A HREF="3_6Security.html#sec:Config-Security"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

What happens if the central manager crashes?
</H2>

<P>
If the central manager crashes, jobs that are already running will
continue to run unaffected.
Queued jobs will remain in the queue unharmed, but can not begin
running until the central manager is restarted and begins matchmaking
again.
Nothing special needs to be done after the central manager is brought
back on line.

Why did the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon die and restart?
</H2>

<P>
The <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon receives signal 25,
dies, and is restarted when the
history file reaches a 2 Gbyte size limit.
Until a larger history file size or the rotation of the history
file is supported in Condor,
try one of these work arounds:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>When the history file becomes large, remove it.
Note that this causes a loss of the information in the history file,
but the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon will not die.
</LI>
<LI>When the history file becomes large, move it.
</LI>
<LI>Stop keeping the history.
Only <I>condor_history</I> accesses the history file, 
so this particular functionality will be gone.
To stop keeping the history, place
<PRE>
HISTORY=
</PRE>
in the configuration,
followed by a <I>condor_reconfig</I> command to recognize the change in
currently executing daemons.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00874000000000000000">
When I ssh/telnet to a machine to check particulars of how
Condor is doing something, it is always vacating or unclaimed when I
know a job had been running there!</A>
</H2>

<P>
Depending on how your policy is set up, Condor will track <I>any</I> tty
on the machine for the purpose of determining if a job is to be vacated
or suspended on the machine. It could be the case that after you ssh
there, Condor notices activity on the tty allocated to your connection
and then vacates the job.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00875000000000000000">
What is wrong? I get no output from <I>condor_status</I>, but the Condor daemons are running.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<U>One likely error message</U> within the collector log of the form
<PRE>
DaemonCore: PERMISSION DENIED to host &lt;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&gt; for command 0 (UPDATE_STARTD_AD)
</PRE>indicates a permissions problem.
The <I>condor_startd</I> daemons do not have write permission to the
<I>condor_collector</I> daemon.
This could be because
you used domain names in your <TT>HOSTALLOW_WRITE</TT> and/or
<TT>HOSTDENY_WRITE</TT> configuration macros,
but the domain name server (DNS) is not properly configured at your site.
Without the proper configuration, Condor cannot resolve
the IP addresses of your machines
into fully-qualified domain names (an inverse look up).
If this is the problem, then the solution takes one of two forms:

<OL>
<LI>Fix the DNS so that inverse look ups (trying to get the domain name
   from an IP address) works for your machines.  You can
   either fix the DNS itself,
   or use the <TT>DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME</TT> setting in your Condor
         configuration file.
</LI>
<LI>Use numeric IP addresses in the <TT>HOSTALLOW_WRITE</TT> and/or
   <TT>HOSTDENY_WRITE</TT> configuration macros
   instead of domain names.
   As an example of this, assume your site has a machine such as
   foo.your.domain.com, and it has two subnets, with IP addresses
   129.131.133.10, and 129.131.132.10.
   If the configuration macro is set as 

<P>
<PRE>
 HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain.com
</PRE>

<P>
and this does not work, use

<P>
<PRE>
 HOSTALLOW_WRITE = 192.131.133.*, 192.131.132.*
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<U>Alternatively</U>, this permissions problem
may be caused by being too restrictive in the setting of
your <TT>HOSTALLOW_WRITE</TT> and/or
<TT>HOSTDENY_WRITE</TT> configuration macros.
If it is, then the solution is to change the macros,
for example from
<PRE>
 HOSTALLOW_WRITE = condor.your.domain.com
</PRE>
to
<PRE>
 HOSTALLOW_WRITE = *.your.domain.com
</PRE>
or possibly
<PRE>
 HOSTALLOW_WRITE = condor.your.domain.com, foo.your.domain.com, \
 bar.your.domain.com
</PRE>
<P>
<U>Another likely error message</U> within the collector log of the form
<PRE>
DaemonCore: PERMISSION DENIED to host &lt;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&gt; for command 5 (QUERY_STARTD_ADS)
</PRE>indicates a similar problem as above, but read permission
is the problem (as opposed to write permission).
Use the solutions given above.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00876000000000000000">
Why does Condor leave mail processes around?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Under FreeBSD and Mac OSX operating systems,
misconfiguration of of a system's outgoing mail causes
Condor to inadvertently leave paused and zombie mail
processes around when Condor attempts to send notification e-mail.
The solution to this problem is
to correct the mailer configuration.

<P>
Execute the following command as the user under which Condor
daemons run to determine whether outgoing e-mail works.

<P>
<PRE>
$ uname -a | mail -v your@emailaddress.com
</PRE>

<P>
If no e-mail arrives, then outgoing e-mail does not work
correctly.

<P>
Note that this problem does not manifest itself
on non-BSD Unix platforms, such as Linux.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00877000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:xen-jiffies-bug"></A>
<BR>
Why are there spurious Condor errors on some machines running Xen kernels?
</H2>

<P>
Some older Xen kernels had a problem where the kernel's jiffy counter
could jump backwards in time. This breaks an assumption made by the
<I>condor_procd</I>. This problem can only be worked around by upgrading
the Xen kernel to a version that fixes the issue with the jiffy counter.
Running Condor on an affected Xen kernel often results in failures
of the following forms in Condor daemon log files:

<UL>
<LI><code>error: parent process's birthday is later than our own</code>
</LI>
<LI><code>ERROR: No family with the given PID is registered</code>
</LI>
</UL>
