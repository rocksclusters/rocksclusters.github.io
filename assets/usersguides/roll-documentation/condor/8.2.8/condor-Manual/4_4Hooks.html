4.4 Hooks
</H1>
A <I>hook</I> is an external program or script invoked by HTCondor.

<P>
Job hooks that fetch work allow sites to write their own programs or scripts, 
and allow HTCondor to invoke these hooks at the right moments 
to accomplish the desired outcome.
This eliminates the expense of the matchmaking and scheduling provided 
by the <I>condor_schedd</I> and the <I>condor_negotiator</I>,
although at the price of the flexibility they offer. 
Therefore, job hooks that fetch work allow HTCondor to more easily and directly
interface with external scheduling systems. 

<P>
Hooks may also behave as a Job Router.

<P>
The Daemon ClassAd hooks permit the <I>condor_startd</I> and 
the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemons to execute hooks once or on a periodic basis.

<P>
Note that standard universe jobs execute different <I>condor_starter</I> and
<I>condor_shadow</I> daemons that do not implement any hook mechanisms.

<P>

4.4.1 Job Hooks That Fetch Work
</H2>

<P>
In the past, HTCondor has always sent work to the execute machines by
pushing jobs to the <I>condor_startd</I> daemon, either from the <I>condor_schedd</I>
daemon or via <I>condor_cod</I>.
Beginning with the HTCondor version 7.1.0, the <I>condor_startd</I> daemon now has the
ability to pull work by fetching jobs via a system of plug-ins or
hooks.
Any site can configure a set of hooks to fetch work, completely
outside of the usual HTCondor matchmaking system.

<P>
A projected use of the hook mechanism implements what might
be termed a <I>glide-in factory</I>, especially where the
factory is behind a firewall.
Without using the hook mechanism to fetch work,
a glide-in <I>condor_startd</I> daemon behind a firewall
depends on CCB to help it listen and eventually receive
work pushed from elsewhere.
With the hook mechanism, a glide-in <I>condor_startd</I> daemon
behind a firewall uses the hook to pull work.
The hook needs only an outbound network connection to complete
its task,
thereby being able to operate from behind the firewall,
without the intervention of CCB.

<P>
Periodically, each execution slot managed by a <I>condor_startd</I> will
invoke a hook to see if there is any work that can be fetched.
Whenever this hook returns a valid job, the <I>condor_startd</I> will
evaluate the current state of the slot and decide if it should start
executing the fetched work.
If the slot is unclaimed and the <TT>Start</TT> expression evaluates to
<TT>True</TT>, a new claim will be created for the fetched job.
If the slot is claimed, the <I>condor_startd</I> will evaluate the
<TT>Rank</TT> expression relative to the fetched job, compare it to
the value of <TT>Rank</TT> for the currently running job, and decide
if the existing job should be preempted due to the fetched job having
a higher rank.
If the slot is unavailable for whatever reason, the <I>condor_startd</I>
will refuse the fetched job and ignore it.
Either way, once the <I>condor_startd</I> decides what it should do with
the fetched job, it will invoke another hook to reply to the attempt
to fetch work, so that the external system knows what happened to that
work unit.

<P>
If the job is accepted, a claim is created for it and the slot moves
into the Claimed state.
As soon as this happens, the <I>condor_startd</I> will spawn a
<I>condor_starter</I> to manage the execution of the job.
At this point, from the perspective of the <I>condor_startd</I>, this claim
is just like any other.
The usual policy expressions are evaluated, and if the job needs to be
suspended or evicted, it will be.
If a higher-ranked job being managed by a <I>condor_schedd</I> is matched
with the slot, that job will preempt the fetched work.

<P>
The <I>condor_starter</I> itself can optionally invoke additional hooks to
help manage the execution of the specific job.
There are hooks to prepare the execution environment for the job,
periodically update information about the job as it runs, notify when
the job exits, and to take special actions when the job is being evicted.

<P>
Assuming there are no interruptions, the job completes, and the
<I>condor_starter</I> exits, the <I>condor_startd</I> will invoke the hook to
fetch work again.
If another job is available, the existing claim will be reused and a
new <I>condor_starter</I> is spawned.
If the hook returns that there is no more work to perform, the claim
will be evicted, and the slot will return to the Owner state.

<P>

4.4.1.1 Work Fetching Hooks Invoked by HTCondor
</H3> 

<P>
There are a handful of hooks invoked by HTCondor related to fetching
work, some of which are called by the <I>condor_startd</I> and others by
the <I>condor_starter</I>.
Each hook is described, including when it is invoked, what
task it is supposed to accomplish, what data is passed to the hook,
what output is expected, and, when relevant, the exit status expected.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>

</DD>
<DT>Hook: Fetch Work</DT>
<DD><P>
The hook defined by the configuration variable
<TT>&lt;Keyword&gt;_HOOK_FETCH_WORK</TT><A NAME="46133"></A><A NAME="46134"></A> is invoked whenever the <I>condor_startd</I>
wants to see if there is any work to fetch.
There is a related configuration variable called
<TT>FetchWorkDelay</TT><A NAME="46140"></A><A NAME="46141"></A> which determines how long the <I>condor_startd</I>
will wait between attempts to fetch work, which is described in detail
in within section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:job-hooks-fetch-work-delay">4.4.1</A> on
page&nbsp;<A HREF="4_4Hooks.html#sec:job-hooks-fetch-work-delay"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.
<TT>&lt;Keyword&gt;_HOOK_FETCH_WORK</TT> is the most important hook in the whole
system, and is the only hook that must be defined for any of the other
<I>condor_startd</I> hooks to operate.

<P>
The job ClassAd returned by the hook needs to contain enough
information for the <I>condor_starter</I> to eventually spawn the work.
The required and optional attributes in this ClassAd are identical to
the ones described for Computing on Demand (COD) jobs in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="4_3Computing_On.html#sec:cod-application-attributes">4.3.3</A> 
on COD Application Attributes, 
page&nbsp;<A HREF="4_3Computing_On.html#sec:cod-application-attributes"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

4.4.1.2 Keywords to Define Job Fetch Hooks in the HTCondor Configuration files 
</H3> 

<P>
Hooks are defined in the HTCondor configuration files by prefixing
the name of the hook with a keyword.
This way, a given machine can have multiple sets of hooks, each set
identified by a specific keyword.

<P>
Each slot on the machine can define a separate keyword for the set
of hooks that should be used with <TT>SLOT&lt;N&gt;_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD</TT><A NAME="46328"></A><A NAME="46329"></A>.
For example, on slot 1, the variable name will be
called <TT>SLOT1_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD</TT>.
If the slot-specific keyword is not defined, the <I>condor_startd</I> will
use a global keyword as defined by <TT>STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD</TT><A NAME="46336"></A><A NAME="46337"></A>.

<P>
Once a job is fetched via <TT>&lt;Keyword&gt;_HOOK_FETCH_WORK</TT><A NAME="46341"></A><A NAME="46342"></A>, the
<I>condor_startd</I> will insert the keyword used to fetch that job into
the job ClassAd as <TT>HookKeyword</TT>.
This way, the same keyword will be used to select the hooks invoked by
the <I>condor_starter</I> during the actual execution of the job.
However, the <TT>STARTER_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD</TT><A NAME="46351"></A><A NAME="46352"></A> can be defined to
force the <I>condor_starter</I> to always use a given keyword for its own
hooks, instead of looking the job ClassAd for a <TT>HookKeyword</TT>
attribute.

<P>
For example, the following configuration defines two sets of hooks,
and on a machine with 4 slots, 3 of the slots use the global keyword
for running work from a database-driven system, and one of the slots
uses a custom keyword to handle work fetched from a web service.
<PRE>
  # Most slots fetch and run work from the database system.
  STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = DATABASE

  # Slot4 fetches and runs work from a web service.
  SLOT4_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = WEB

  # The database system needs to both provide work and know the reply
  # for each attempted claim.
  DATABASE_HOOK_DIR = /usr/local/condor/fetch/database
  DATABASE_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(DATABASE_HOOK_DIR)/fetch_work.php
  DATABASE_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH = $(DATABASE_HOOK_DIR)/reply_fetch.php

  # The web system only needs to fetch work.
  WEB_HOOK_DIR = /usr/local/condor/fetch/web
  WEB_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(WEB_HOOK_DIR)/fetch_work.php
</PRE>
<P>
The keywords <TT>"DATABASE"</TT> and <TT>"WEB"</TT> are completely arbitrary, so
each site is encouraged to use different (more specific) names as
appropriate for their own needs.

<P>

<BR>
4.4.1.3 Defining the FetchWorkDelay Expression
</H3>

<P>
There are two events that trigger the <I>condor_startd</I> to attempt to
fetch new work:

<UL>
<LI>the <I>condor_startd</I> evaluates its own state
</LI>
<LI>the <I>condor_starter</I> exits after completing some fetched work
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Even if a given compute slot is already busy running other work, it is
possible that if it fetched new work, the <I>condor_startd</I> would prefer
this newly fetched work (via the <TT>Rank</TT> expression) over the work it
is currently running.
However, the <I>condor_startd</I> frequently evaluates its own state,
especially when a slot is claimed.
Therefore, administrators can define a configuration variable which controls
how long the <I>condor_startd</I> will wait between attempts to fetch new work.
This variable is called <TT>FetchWorkDelay</TT><A NAME="46374"></A><A NAME="46375"></A>.

<P>
The <TT>FetchWorkDelay</TT> expression must evaluate to an integer,
which defines the number of seconds since the last fetch attempt
completed before the <I>condor_startd</I> will attempt to fetch more work.
However, as a ClassAd expression (evaluated in the context of the
ClassAd of the slot considering if it should fetch more work, and the
ClassAd of the currently running job, if any), the length of the delay
can be based on the current state the slot and even the currently
running job.

<P>
For example, a common configuration would be to always wait 5
minutes (300 seconds) between attempts to fetch work, unless the slot
is Claimed/Idle, in which case the <I>condor_startd</I> should fetch
immediately:

<P>
<PRE>
FetchWorkDelay = ifThenElse(State == "Claimed" &amp;&amp; Activity == "Idle", 0, 300)
</PRE>
<P>
If the <I>condor_startd</I> wants to fetch work, but the time since the
last attempted fetch is shorter than the current value of the delay
expression, the <I>condor_startd</I> will set a timer to fetch as soon as
the delay expires.

<P>
If this expression is not defined, the <I>condor_startd</I> will default to
a five minute (300 second) delay between all attempts to fetch work.

4.4.1.4 Example Hook: Specifying the Executable at Execution Time
</H3>

<P>
The availability of multiple versions of an application leads to
the need to specify one of the versions. 
As an example, consider that 
the java universe utilizes a single, fixed JVM.
There may be multiple JVMs available, and the HTCondor job may
need to make the choice of JVM version.
The use of a job hook solves this problem.
The job does not use the java universe, and instead uses the
vanilla universe in combination with a 
prepare job hook to overwrite the <TT>Cmd</TT> attribute of the job ClassAd.
This attribute is the name of the
executable the <I>condor_starter</I> daemon will invoke,
thereby selecting the specific JVM installation.

<P>
In the configuration of the execute machine:

<P>
<PRE>
JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB = $(LIBEXEC)/java5_prepare_hook
</PRE>
<P>
With this configuration, a job that sets the <TT>HookKeyword</TT> attribute with

<P>
<PRE>
+HookKeyword = "JAVA5"
</PRE>

<P>
in the submit description file causes the <I>condor_starter</I>
will run the hook specified by <TT>JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB</TT><A NAME="46396"></A><A NAME="46397"></A>
before running this job.
Note that the double quote marks are required to correctly define
the attribute.
Any output from this hook is an update to the job ClassAd.  
Therefore, the hook that changes the executable may be

<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

# Read and discard the job ClassAd
cat &gt; /dev/null
echo 'Cmd = "/usr/java/java5/bin/java"'
</PRE>

<P>
If some machines in your pool have this hook and others do not,
this fact should be advertised.
Add to the configuration of every execute machine that has the hook:

<P>
<PRE>
HasJava5PrepareHook = True
STARTD_ATTRS = HasJava5PrepareHook $(STARTD_ATTRS)
</PRE>

<P>
The submit description file for this example job may be
<PRE>
universe = vanilla
executable = /usr/bin/java
arguments = Hello
# match with a machine that has the hook
requirements = HasJava5PrepareHook

should_transfer_files = always
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
transfer_input_files = Hello.class

output = hello.out
error  = hello.err
log    = hello.log

+HookKeyword="JAVA5"
queue
</PRE>Note that the <B>requirements</B><A NAME="46401"></A> command ensures that this job
matches with a machine that has <TT>JAVA5_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB</TT> defined.

4.4.2 Hooks for a Job Router
</H2> 

<P>
Job Router Hooks allow for an alternate transformation and/or 
monitoring than the <I>condor_job_router</I> daemon implements.
Routing is still managed by the <I>condor_job_router</I> daemon,
but if the Job Router Hooks are specified,
then these hooks will be used to transform
and monitor the job instead.

<P>
Job Router Hooks are similar in concept to Fetch Work Hooks,
but they are limited in their scope.
A hook is an external program or script invoked by the <I>condor_job_router</I>
daemon at various points during the life cycle of a routed job.

<P>
The following sections describe how and when these hooks are used,
what hooks are invoked at various stages of the job's life, 
and how to configure HTCondor to use these Hooks.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00542100000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:job-hooks-JR"></A>
<A NAME="46032"></A>
<BR>
4.4.2.1 Hooks Invoked for Job Routing
</H3>

<P>
The Job Router Hooks allow for replacement of the transformation engine used
by HTCondor for routing a job.
Since the external transformation engine is not controlled by HTCondor,
additional hooks provide a means to update the job's
status in HTCondor, and to clean up upon exit or failure cases.
This allows one job to be transformed to just about any other type of job
that HTCondor supports,
as well as to use execution nodes not normally available to HTCondor.

<P>
It is important to note that if the Job Router Hooks are utilized, 
then HTCondor will not ignore or work around a failure in any hook execution.
If a hook is configured,
then HTCondor assumes its invocation is required and will not
continue by falling back to a part of its internal engine.
For example,
if there is a problem transforming the job using the hooks,
HTCondor will not fall back on its transformation accomplished without the hook
to process the job.

<P>
There are 2 ways in which the Job Router Hooks may be enabled.
A job's submit description file may cause the hooks to be invoked with 
<PRE>
  +HookKeyword = "HOOKNAME"
</PRE>Adding this attribute to the job's ClassAd causes the <I>condor_job_router</I>
daemon on the submit machine to invoke hooks prefixed with the defined keyword.
<TT>HOOKNAME</TT> is a string chosen as an example; any string may be used.

<P>
The job's ClassAd attribute definition of <TT>HookKeyword</TT> takes
precedence,
but if not present, hooks may be enabled by defining on the submit machine
the configuration variable 
<PRE>
 JOB_ROUTER_HOOK_KEYWORD = HOOKNAME
</PRE>Like the example attribute above,
<TT>HOOKNAME</TT> represents a chosen name for the hook, 
replaced as desired or appropriate.

<P>
There are 4 hooks that the Job Router can be configured to use.
Each hook will be described below along with data passed 
to the hook and expected output.
All hooks must exit successfully.

4.4.3 Daemon ClassAd Hooks
</H2> 

<P>
The <I>Daemon ClassAd Hook</I> mechanism is
used to run executables (called jobs) directly from the
<I>condor_startd</I> and <I>condor_schedd</I> daemons. 
The output from these jobs is incorporated into the machine ClassAd
generated by the respective daemon.
The mechanism and associated jobs have been identified by various
names, including the <I>Startd Cron</I>, dynamic attributes,
and a distribution of executables collectively known as <I>Hawkeye</I>.

<P>
Pool management tasks can be enhanced by using a 
daemon's ability to periodically run executables.
The executables are expected to generate ClassAd attributes as their output,
which are incorporated into the machine ClassAd.
Policy expressions may then reference the dynamic attributes.

<P>
Configuration variables related to Daemon ClassAd Hooks are defined
within section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_3Configuration.html#sec:Config-hooks">3.3.35</A>.

<P>
The output of the job is incorporated into the ClassAd when
the job exits,
or when the job outputs a specialized line containing a 
dash as the first character.
The remainder of the line is discarded.

<P>
Here is a complete configuration example.
It defines all three of the available types of jobs:
ones that use the <I>condor_startd</I>, benchmark jobs,
and ones that use the <I>condor_schedd</I>.
