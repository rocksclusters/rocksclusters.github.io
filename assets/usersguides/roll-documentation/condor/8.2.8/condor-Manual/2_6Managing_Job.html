2.6 Managing a Job</A>
</H1>
This section provides a brief summary of what can be done once jobs
are submitted. The basic mechanisms for monitoring a job are
introduced, but the commands are discussed briefly.
You are encouraged to
look at the man pages of the commands referred to (located in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="11_Command_Reference.html#sec:command-reference">11</A> beginning on
page&nbsp;<A HREF="11_Command_Reference.html#sec:command-reference"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>) for more information. 

<P>
When jobs are submitted, HTCondor will attempt to find resources
to run the jobs. 
A list of all those with jobs submitted
may be obtained through <I>condor_status</I>
<A NAME="3377"></A>
with the 
<I>-submitters</I> option. 
An example of this would yield output similar to:

</PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
</FONT>This output contains many columns of information about the
queued jobs.
<A NAME="3387"></A>
<A NAME="3388"></A>
The <code>ST</code> column (for status) shows the status of
current jobs in the queue:
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><code>R</code>:  The job is currently running.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><code>I</code>:  The job is idle.  It is not running right
now, because it is waiting for a machine to become available.
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><code>H</code>:  The job is the hold state. In the hold state,
the job will not be scheduled to
run until it is released. See the <I>condor_hold</I>
manual page located on page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_hold.html#man-condor-hold"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>
and the <I>condor_release</I>
manual page located on page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_release.html#man-condor-release"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.
</DD>
</DL> 
The <code>RUN_TIME</code> time reported for a job is the time that has been
committed to the job.

<P>
Another useful method of tracking the progress of jobs is through the
job event log.  The specification of a <TT>log</TT> in 
the submit description file causes the progress of the job 
to be logged in a file.  Follow the events by viewing the
job event log file.  
Various events such as execution commencement, checkpoint, eviction 
and termination are logged in the file.
Also logged is the time at which the event occurred.

<P>
When a job begins to run, HTCondor starts up a <I>condor_shadow</I> process
<A NAME="3400"></A>
<A NAME="3401"></A>
on the submit machine.  The shadow process is the mechanism by which the
remotely executing jobs can access the environment from which it was
submitted, such as input and output files.  

<P>
It is normal for a machine which has submitted hundreds of jobs to have 
hundreds of <I>condor_shadow</I> processes running on the machine.
Since the text segments of all these processes is the same,
the load on the submit machine is usually not significant.
If there is degraded performance, limit 
the number of jobs that can run simultaneously by reducing the 
<TT>MAX_JOBS_RUNNING</TT><A NAME="3690"></A><A NAME="3691"></A> configuration variable.

<P>
You can also find all the machines that are running your job through the
<I>condor_status</I> command.
<A NAME="3405"></A>
For example, to find all the machines that are
running jobs submitted by <TT>breach@cs.wisc.edu</TT>, type:
<PRE>

2.6.3 Placing a job on hold
</H2>
A job in the queue may be placed on hold by running the command
<I>condor_hold</I>.
A job in the hold state remains in the hold state until later released
for execution by the command <I>condor_release</I>.

<P>
Use of the <I>condor_hold</I> command causes a hard kill signal to be sent
to a currently running job (one in the running state).
For a standard universe job, this means that no checkpoint is
generated before the job stops running and enters the hold state.
When released, this standard universe job continues its execution
using the most recent checkpoint available.

<P>
Jobs in universes other than the standard universe that are running
when placed on hold will start over from the beginning when 
released.

2.6.4 Changing the priority of jobs
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="3428"></A>
<A NAME="3429"></A>
In addition to the priorities assigned to each user, HTCondor also provides
each user with the capability of assigning priorities to each submitted job.
These job priorities are local to each queue and can be any integer value, with
higher values meaning better priority.

<P>
The default priority of a job is 0, but can be changed using the <I>condor_prio</I>
command.
<A NAME="3431"></A>
For example, to change the priority of a job to -15,
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>
It is important to note that these <I>job</I> priorities are completely 
different from the <I>user</I> priorities assigned by HTCondor.  Job priorities
do not impact user priorities.  They are only a mechanism for the user to
identify the relative importance of jobs among all the jobs submitted by the
user to that specific queue.

2.6.5 Why is the job not running?
</H2>
Users occasionally find that their jobs do not run.
There are many possible reasons why a specific job is not running.
The following prose attempts to identify some of the potential issues
behind why a job is not running.

<P>
At the most basic level, the user knows the status of a job by
using <I>condor_q</I> to see that the job is not running.
By far, the most common reason (to the novice HTCondor job submitter)
why the job is not running is that HTCondor has not yet 
been through its periodic negotiation cycle,
in which queued jobs are assigned to machines within the pool 
and begin their execution.
This periodic event occurs by default once every 5 minutes,
implying that the user ought to wait a few minutes before
searching for reasons why the job is not running.

<P>
Further inquiries are dependent on whether the job has 
never run at all, or has run for at least a little bit.

<P>
For jobs that have never run,
<A NAME="3440"></A>
many problems can be diagnosed by using the <B>-analyze</B>
option of the <I>condor_q</I> command.
Here is an example; 
running <I>condor_q</I>'s analyzer provided the following information:

<P>

<P>
This example also shows that the job does not run because the 
platform requested, Mac OS X, is not available on any of the 
machines in the pool.
Recall that unless informed otherwise in the <B>Requirements</B><A NAME="3720"></A>
expression in the submit description file,
the platform requested for an execute machine will be the same
as the platform where <I>condor_submit</I> is run to submit the job.
And, while Mac OS X is a Unix-type operating system, it is
not the same as Linux, and thus will not match with machines
running Linux.

<P>
While the analyzer can diagnose most common problems, there are some situations
that it cannot reliably detect due to the instantaneous and local nature of the
information it uses to detect the problem.  Thus, it may be that the analyzer
reports that resources are available to service the request, but the job still 
has not run.  In most of these situations, the delay is transient, and the
job will run following the next negotiation cycle.

<P>
A second class of problems represents jobs that do or did run,
for at least a short while, but are no longer running.
The first issue is identifying whether the job is in this category.
The <I>condor_q</I> command is not enough; it only tells the
current state of the job.
The needed information will be in the <B>log</B><A NAME="3726"></A> file 
or the <B>error</B><A NAME="3728"></A> file, as defined in the submit description file
for the job.
If these files are not defined, then there is little hope of
determining if the job ran at all.
For a job that ran, even for the briefest amount of time,
the <B>log</B><A NAME="3730"></A> file will contain an event of type 1,
which will contain the string
<code>Job executing on host</code>.

<P>
A job may run for a short time, before failing due to a file permission
problem.
The log file used by the <I>condor_shadow</I> daemon will contain more information
if this is the problem.
This log file is associated with the machine on which the job was submitted.
The location and name of this log file may be discovered on the
submitting machine, using the command
<PRE>
%  condor_config_val SHADOW_LOG
</PRE>
<P>
Memory and swap space problems may be identified by looking at the log
file used by the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon.
The location and name of this log file may be discovered on the
submitting machine, using the command
<PRE>
%  condor_config_val SCHEDD_LOG
</PRE>A swap space problem will show in the log with the following message:
<PRE>
2/3 17:46:53 Swap space estimate reached! No more jobs can be run!
12/3 17:46:53     Solution: get more swap space, or set RESERVED_SWAP = 0
12/3 17:46:53     0 jobs matched, 1 jobs idle
</PRE>As an explanation,
HTCondor computes the total swap space on the submit machine.
It then tries to limit the total number of jobs it
will spawn based on an estimate of the size of the <I>condor_shadow</I>
daemon's memory footprint and a configurable amount of swap space
that should be reserved.
This is done to avoid the
situation within a very large pool
in which all the jobs are submitted from a single host.
The huge number of <I>condor_shadow</I> processes would
overwhelm the submit machine,
and it would run out of swap space and thrash.

<P>
Things can go wrong if a machine has a lot of physical memory and
little or no swap space.
HTCondor does not consider the physical memory size,
so the situation occurs where HTCondor thinks
it has no swap space to work with,
and it will not run the submitted jobs.

<P>
To see how much swap space HTCondor thinks a given machine has, use
the output of a <I>condor_status</I> command of the following form:

<P>
<PRE>
% condor_status -schedd [hostname] -long | grep VirtualMemory
</PRE>If the value listed is 0, then this is what is confusing HTCondor.
There are two ways to fix the problem:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Configure the machine with some real swap space.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Disable this check within HTCondor.
Define the amount of reserved swap space for the submit machine to 0.
Set <TT>RESERVED_SWAP</TT><A NAME="3742"></A><A NAME="3743"></A> to 0 in the configuration file:

<P>
<PRE>
RESERVED_SWAP = 0
</PRE>

<P>
and then send a <I>condor_restart</I> to the submit machine.
</LI>
</OL>

2.6.6 Job in the Hold State
</H2>
A variety of errors and unusual conditions may cause a job to be placed
into the Hold state.
The job will stay in this state and in the job queue until
conditions are corrected and <I>condor_release</I> is invoked.

<P>
A table listing the reasons why a job may be held is at
section&nbsp;<A HREF="12_Appendix_A.html#HoldReasonCode-job-attribute">12</A>.
A string identifying the reason that a particular job is in the 
Hold state may be displayed by invoking <I>condor_q</I>.
For the example job ID 16.0, use:
<PRE> 
  condor_q  -hold  16.0
</PRE> 

<P>
This command prints information about the job, including 
the job ClassAd attribute <TT>HoldReason</TT>.

2.6.7 In the Job Event Log File
</H2>
In a job event log file are a listing of events in
chronological order that occurred during the life of one or more jobs.
The formatting of the events is always the same, 
so that they may be machine readable.
Four fields are always present,
and they will most often be followed by other fields that give further
information that is specific to the type of event.

<P>
The first field in an event is the numeric value assigned as the
event type in a 3-digit format.
The second field identifies the job which generated the event. 
Within parentheses are the job ClassAd attributes of
<TT>ClusterId</TT> value, 
<TT>ProcId</TT> value, 
and the node number  for parallel universe jobs or a set of zeros
(for jobs run under all other universes),
separated by periods.
The third field is the date and time of the event logging.  
The fourth field is a string that briefly describes the event.
Fields that follow the fourth field give further information for the specific
event type.

<P>
These are all of the events that can show up in a job log file:

<P>

2.6.8 Job Completion
</H2>

<P>
When an HTCondor job completes,
either through normal means or by abnormal termination by signal,
HTCondor will remove it from the job queue.
That is,
the job will no longer appear in the output of <I>condor_q</I>,
and the job will be inserted into the job history file.
Examine the job history file with the <I>condor_history</I> command. 
If there is a log file specified in the submit description file for the job, 
then the job exit status will be recorded there as well.

<P>
<A NAME="3605"></A>
By default, HTCondor does not send an email message when the job completes.
Modify this behavior with the
<B>notification</B><A NAME="3892"></A> command in the submit description file.
The message will include the exit status of the job,
which is the argument that the job passed to the exit system call 
when it completed,
or it will be notification that the job was killed by a signal.  
Notification will also
include the following statistics (as appropriate) about the job:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Submitted at:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>when the job was submitted with <I>condor_submit</I>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Completed at:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>when the job completed

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Real Time:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the elapsed time between when the job was submitted and
when it completed, given in a form of <TT>&lt;days&gt; &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;</TT>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Virtual Image Size:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>memory size of the job, computed when the
job checkpoints

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Statistics about just the last time the job ran:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Run Time:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>total time the job was running,
given in the form <TT>&lt;days&gt; &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;</TT>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Remote User Time:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>total CPU time the job spent
executing in user mode on remote machines; 
this does not count time spent on run attempts that were evicted 
without a checkpoint.
Given in the form <TT>&lt;days&gt; &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;</TT>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Remote System Time:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>total CPU time the job spent
executing in system mode (the time spent at system calls);
this does not count time spent on run attempts that were evicted 
without a checkpoint.  
Given in the form <TT>&lt;days&gt; &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;</TT>

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The Run Time accumulated by all run attempts are summarized with
the time given in the form <TT>&lt;days&gt; &lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;</TT>.

<P>
And, statistics about the bytes sent and received by the last
run of the job and summed over all attempts at running the job
are given.
