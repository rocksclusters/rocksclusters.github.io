2.5 Submitting a Job
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="1944"></A>
A job is submitted for execution to HTCondor using the
<I>condor_submit</I> command.
<A NAME="1946"></A>
<I>condor_submit</I> takes as an argument the name of a
file called a submit description file.
<A NAME="1948"></A>
<A NAME="1949"></A>
This file contains commands and keywords to direct the queuing of jobs.
In the submit description file, HTCondor finds everything it needs
to know about the job.  Items such as the name of the executable to run,
the initial working directory, and command-line arguments to the
program all go into
the submit description file.  <I>condor_submit</I> creates a job
ClassAd based upon the information,
and HTCondor
works toward running the job.

<P>
<A NAME="1951"></A>
The contents of a submit description file have been designed to
save time for HTCondor users.
It is easy to submit multiple runs of a program to HTCondor
with a single submit description file.
To run the same program many times on
different input data sets, arrange the data files
accordingly so that each run reads its own input, and each run
writes its own output.
Each individual run may have its own initial
working directory, files mapped for <TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>,
<TT>stderr</TT>, command-line arguments, and
shell environment;  these are all specified in the submit description file.
A program that directly opens its own
files will read the file names to use either from <TT>stdin</TT>
or from the command line. 
A program that opens a static file, given by file name, every time
will need to use a separate subdirectory for the output of each run.

<P>
The <I>condor_submit</I> manual page 
is on page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_submit.html#man-condor-submit"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> and
contains a complete and full description of how to use <I>condor_submit</I>.
It also includes descriptions of all the many commands that may be placed
into a submit description file.
In addition, the index lists entries for each command under the
heading of Submit Commands.

2.5.1 Sample submit description files
</H2>  

<P>
In addition to the examples of submit description files given
here, there are more in the <I>condor_submit</I> manual page.
<A NAME="1961"></A>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Example 1</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>
Example 1 is one of the simplest submit description files possible. 
It queues up the program <I>myexe</I> for execution somewhere in the pool. 
Use of the vanilla universe is implied, as that is the default when
not specified in the submit description file.

<P>
An executable is compiled to run on a specific platform.
Since this submit description file does not specify a platform,
HTCondor will use its default,
which is to run the job on a machine which has the same architecture 
and operating system as the machine where <I>condor_submit</I> is run
to submit the job. 

<P>
Standard input for this job will come from file <TT>inputfile</TT>,
as specified by the <B>input</B><A NAME="2141"></A> command,
and standard output for this job will go to file <TT>outputfile</TT>,
as specified by the <B>output</B><A NAME="2144"></A> command.
HTCondor expects to find these files in the current working directory,
as this job is submitted,
and the system will take care of getting the input file 
to where it needs to be when the job is executed,
as well as bring back the output results after job execution.

<P>
A log file, <TT>myexe.log</TT>, will also be produced that contains events
the job had during its lifetime inside of HTCondor.
When the job finishes, its exit conditions will be noted in the log file.
This file's contents are an excellent way to figure out what
happened to submitted jobs.

Example 2 queues up one copy of the program <I>foo</I>
(which had been created by <I>condor_compile</I>)
for execution by HTCondor.
No <B>input</B><A NAME="2150"></A>, <B>output</B><A NAME="2152"></A>, or <B>error</B><A NAME="2154"></A>
commands are given in the submit description file,
so <TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>, and <TT>stderr</TT> will all refer to 
<TT>/dev/null</TT>.
The program may produce output by explicitly opening a file and writing to
it.

<P>
Example 3 queues two copies of the program <I>mathematica</I>. The
first copy will run in directory <TT>run_1</TT>, and the second will run in
directory <TT>run_2</TT> due to the <B>initialdir</B><A NAME="2163"></A> command.
For each copy, 
<TT>stdin</TT> will be <TT>test.data</TT>,
<TT>stdout</TT> will be <TT>loop.out</TT>, and
<TT>stderr</TT> will be <TT>loop.error</TT>.
Each run will read input and write output files within its own directory.
Placing data files in separate directories 
is a convenient way to organize data when
a large group of HTCondor jobs is to run.
The example file shows program submission of
<I>mathematica</I> as a vanilla universe job.
The vanilla universe is most often the right choice of universe
when the source and/or object code is not available.

<P>
The <B>request_memory</B><A NAME="2172"></A> command is included to ensure
that the <I>mathematica</I> jobs match with and then execute on
pool machines that provide at least 1 GByte of memory.

The submit description file for Example 4 queues 150
<A NAME="2005"></A>
runs of program <I>foo</I> which has been compiled and linked for
Linux running on a 32-bit Intel processor.
This job requires HTCondor to run the program on machines which have
greater than 32 MiB of physical memory, 
and the <B>rank</B><A NAME="2176"></A> command expresses a
preference to run each instance of the program 
on machines with more than 64 MiB.
It also advises HTCondor that this standard universe job will
use up to 28000 KiB of memory when running.
Each of the 150 runs of the program is given its own process number,
starting with process number 0.
So, files 
<TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>, and <TT>stderr</TT> will
refer to <TT>in.0</TT>, <TT>out.0</TT>, and <TT>err.0</TT> for the first run
of the program,
<TT>in.1</TT>, <TT>out.1</TT>,
and <TT>err.1</TT> for the second run of the program, and so forth.
A log file containing entries
about when and where HTCondor runs, checkpoints, and migrates processes for
all the 150 queued programs
will be written into the single file <TT>foo.log</TT>.

2.5.2 About Requirements and Rank
</H2>

<P>
The 
<TT>requirements</TT> and <TT>rank</TT> commands in the submit description file
are powerful and flexible. 
<A NAME="2024"></A>
<A NAME="2025"></A>
<A NAME="2026"></A>
<A NAME="2027"></A>
<A NAME="2028"></A>
Using them effectively requires care, and this section presents
those details.

<P>
Both <TT>requirements</TT> and <TT>rank</TT> need to be specified 
as valid HTCondor ClassAd expressions, however, default values are set by the
<I>condor_submit</I> program if these are not defined in the submit description file.
From the <I>condor_submit</I> manual page and the above examples, you see
that writing ClassAd expressions is intuitive, especially if you
are familiar with the programming language C.  There are some
pretty nifty expressions you can write with ClassAds.
A complete description of ClassAds and their expressions
can be found in section&nbsp;<A HREF="4_1HTCondor_s_ClassAd.html#sec:classad-reference">4.1</A> on 
page&nbsp;<A HREF="4_1HTCondor_s_ClassAd.html#sec:classad-reference"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
All of the commands in the submit description file are case insensitive, 
<I>except</I> for the ClassAd attribute string values.
ClassAd attribute names are
case insensitive, but ClassAd string
values are <I>case preserving</I>.

<P>
Note that the comparison operators
(<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>==</code>)
compare strings
case insensitively.  The special comparison operators 
<code>=?=</code> and <code>=!=</code>
compare strings case sensitively.

<P>
A  <B>requirements</B><A NAME="2196"></A> or <B>rank</B><A NAME="2198"></A> command in
the submit description file may utilize attributes
that appear in a machine or a job ClassAd.
Within the submit description file (for a job) the
prefix <code>MY.</code> (on a ClassAd attribute name)
causes a reference to the job ClassAd attribute,
and the prefix <code>TARGET.</code> causes a reference to 
a potential machine or matched machine ClassAd attribute.

<P>
The <I>condor_status</I> command displays
<A NAME="2040"></A>
statistics about machines within the pool.
The <B>-l</B> option displays the
machine ClassAd attributes for all machines in the HTCondor pool.
The job ClassAds, if there are jobs in the queue, can be seen
with the <I>condor_q -l</I> command.
This shows all the defined attributes for current jobs in the queue.

<P>
A list of defined ClassAd attributes for job ClassAds
is given in the unnumbered Appendix on 
page&nbsp;<A HREF="12_Appendix_A.html#sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

2.5.2.1 Rank Expression Examples
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="2046"></A>
<A NAME="2047"></A>
<A NAME="2048"></A>
When considering the match between a job and a machine, rank is used
to choose a match from among all machines that satisfy the job's
requirements and are available to the user, after accounting for
the user's priority and the machine's rank of the job.
The rank expressions, simple or complex, define a numerical value
that expresses preferences.

<P>
The job's <TT>Rank</TT> expression evaluates to one of three values.
It can be UNDEFINED, ERROR, or a floating point value.
If <TT>Rank</TT> evaluates to a floating point value,
the best match will be the one with the largest, positive value.
If no <TT>Rank</TT> is given 
in the submit description file,
then HTCondor substitutes a default value of 0.0 when considering
machines to match.
If the job's <TT>Rank</TT> of a given machine evaluates
to UNDEFINED or ERROR,
this same value of 0.0 is used.
Therefore, the machine is still considered for a match,
but has no ranking above any other.

<P>
A boolean expression evaluates to the numerical value of 1.0
if true, and 0.0 if false.

<P>
The following <TT>Rank</TT> expressions provide examples to
follow.

<P>
For a job that desires the machine with the most available memory:
<PRE>
   Rank = memory
</PRE>

<P>
For a job that prefers to run on a friend's machine
on Saturdays and Sundays:
<PRE>
   Rank = ( (clockday == 0) || (clockday == 6) )
          &amp;&amp; (machine == "friend.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>

<P>
For a job that prefers to run on one of three specific machines:
<PRE>
   Rank = (machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu") ||
          (machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu") ||
          (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>

<P>
For a job that wants the machine with the best floating point
performance (on Linpack benchmarks):
<PRE>
   Rank = kflops
</PRE>
This particular example highlights a difficulty with <TT>Rank</TT> expression
evaluation as currently defined.
While all machines have floating point processing ability,
not all machines will have the <TT>kflops</TT> attribute defined.
For machines where this attribute is not defined,
<TT>Rank</TT> will evaluate to the value UNDEFINED, and
HTCondor will use a default rank of the machine of 0.0.
The <TT>Rank</TT> attribute will only rank machines where
the attribute is defined.
Therefore, the machine with the highest floating point
performance may not be the one given the highest rank.

<P>
So, it is wise when writing a <TT>Rank</TT> expression to check
if the expression's evaluation will lead to the expected
resulting ranking of machines.
This can be accomplished using the <I>condor_status</I> command with the
<I>-constraint</I> argument.  This allows the user to see a list of
machines that fit a constraint.
To see which machines in the pool have <TT>kflops</TT> defined,
use
<PRE>
condor_status -constraint kflops
</PRE>
Alternatively, to see a list of machines where 
<TT>kflops</TT> is not defined, use
<PRE>
condor_status -constraint "kflops=?=undefined"
</PRE>

<P>
For a job that prefers specific machines in a specific order:
<PRE>
   Rank = ((machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu")*3) +
          ((machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu")*2) +
           (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>
If the machine being ranked is <TT>friend1.cs.wisc.edu</TT>, then the
expression
<PRE>
   (machine == "friend1.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>
is true, and gives the value 1.0.
The expressions
<PRE>
   (machine == "friend2.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>
and
<PRE>
   (machine == "friend3.cs.wisc.edu")
</PRE>
are false, and give the value 0.0.
Therefore, <TT>Rank</TT> evaluates to the value 3.0.
In this way, machine <TT>friend1.cs.wisc.edu</TT> is ranked higher than
machine <TT>friend2.cs.wisc.edu</TT>,
machine <TT>friend2.cs.wisc.edu</TT>
is ranked higher than 
machine <TT>friend3.cs.wisc.edu</TT>,
and all three of these machines are ranked higher than others.

2.5.3 Submitting Jobs Using a Shared File System
</H2>

<P>
If vanilla, java, or parallel universe
jobs are submitted without using the File Transfer mechanism, 
HTCondor must use a shared file system to access input and output
files. 
In this case, the job <I>must</I> be able to access the data files
from any machine on which it could potentially run.

<P>
As an example, suppose a job is submitted from blackbird.cs.wisc.edu,
and the job requires a particular data file called
<TT>/u/p/s/psilord/data.txt</TT>.  If the job were to run on
cardinal.cs.wisc.edu, the file <TT>/u/p/s/psilord/data.txt</TT> must be
available through either NFS or AFS for the job to run correctly.

<P>
HTCondor allows users to ensure their jobs have access to the right
shared files by using the <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> and
<TT>UidDomain</TT> machine ClassAd attributes.
These attributes specify which machines have access to the same shared
file systems.
All machines that mount the same shared directories in the same
locations are considered to belong to the same file system domain.
Similarly, all machines that share the same user information (in
particular, the same UID, which is important for file systems like
NFS) are considered part of the same UID domain.

<P>
The default configuration for HTCondor places each machine
in its own UID domain and file system domain, using the full host name of the
machine as the name of the domains.
So, if a pool <I>does</I> have access to a shared file system,
the pool administrator <I>must</I> correctly configure HTCondor 
such that all
the machines mounting the same files have the same
<TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> configuration.
Similarly, all machines that share common user information must be
configured to have the same <TT>UidDomain</TT> configuration.

<P>
When a job relies on a shared file system,
HTCondor uses the
<TT>requirements</TT> expression to ensure that the job runs
on a machine in the
correct <TT>UidDomain</TT> and <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT>.
In this case, the default <TT>requirements</TT> expression specifies
that the job must run on a machine with the same <TT>UidDomain</TT>
and <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> as the machine from which the job
is submitted.
This default is almost always correct.
However, in a pool spanning multiple <TT>UidDomain</TT>s and/or
<TT>FileSystemDomain</TT>s, the user may need to specify a different
<TT>requirements</TT> expression to have the job run on the correct
machines.

<P>
For example, imagine a pool made up of both desktop workstations and a
dedicated compute cluster.
Most of the pool, including the compute cluster, has access to a
shared file system, but some of the desktop machines do not.
In this case, the administrators would probably define the
<TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> to be <TT>cs.wisc.edu</TT> for all the machines
that mounted the shared files, and to the full host name for each
machine that did not. An example is <TT>jimi.cs.wisc.edu</TT>.

<P>
In this example,
a user wants to submit vanilla universe jobs from her own desktop
machine (jimi.cs.wisc.edu) which does not mount the shared file system
(and is therefore in its own file system domain, in its own world).
But, she wants the jobs to be able to run on more than just her own
machine (in particular, the compute cluster), so she puts the program
and input files onto the shared file system.
When she submits the jobs, she needs to tell HTCondor to send them to
machines that have access to that shared data, so she specifies a
different <TT>requirements</TT> expression than the default:
<PRE>
   Requirements = TARGET.UidDomain == "cs.wisc.edu" &amp;&amp; \
                  TARGET.FileSystemDomain == "cs.wisc.edu"
</PRE>

<P>
<U>WARNING</U>: If there is <I>no</I> shared file system, or the HTCondor pool
administrator does not configure the <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT>
setting correctly (the default is that each machine in a pool is in
its own file system and UID domain), a user submits a job that cannot
use remote system calls (for example, a vanilla universe job), and the
user does not enable HTCondor's File Transfer mechanism, the job will
<I>only</I> run on the machine from which it was submitted.

HTCondor works well without a shared file system.
The HTCondor file transfer mechanism permits the user to select which files are
transferred and under which circumstances.
HTCondor can transfer any files needed by a job from
the machine where the job was submitted into a
remote scratch directory on the machine where the
job is to be executed.
HTCondor executes the job
and transfers output back to the submitting machine.
The user specifies which files and directories to transfer,
and at what point the output files should be copied back to the
submitting machine.
This specification is done within the job's submit description file.

2.5.4.1 Specifying If and When to Transfer Files

</H3>

<P>
To enable the file transfer mechanism, place two commands
in the job's submit description file:
<B>should_transfer_files</B><A NAME="2744"></A> and <B>when_to_transfer_output</B><A NAME="2746"></A>.
By default, they will be:

<P>
<PRE>
  should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED
  when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
</PRE>

<P>
Setting the <B>should_transfer_files</B><A NAME="2748"></A> command explicitly
enables or disables the file transfer mechanism.
The command takes on one of three possible values:

<OL>
<LI><code>YES</code>: HTCondor transfers both the executable and the file
defined by the <B>input</B><A NAME="2750"></A> command from the machine where the job is
submitted to the remote machine where the job is to be executed.
The file defined by the <B>output</B><A NAME="2752"></A> command as well as any files
created by the execution of the job are transferred back to the machine
where the job was submitted.
When they are transferred and the directory location of the files
is determined by the command <B>when_to_transfer_output</B><A NAME="2754"></A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>IF_NEEDED</code>: HTCondor transfers files if the job is
matched with and to be executed on a machine in a
different <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> than the
one the submit machine belongs to, the same as if 
<code>should_transfer_files = YES</code>.
If the job is matched with a machine in the local <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT>,
HTCondor will not transfer files and relies
on the shared file system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>NO</code>: HTCondor's file transfer mechanism is disabled. 

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The <B>when_to_transfer_output</B> command tells HTCondor when output
files are to be transferred back to the submit machine.
The command takes on one of two possible values:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><code>ON_EXIT</code>: HTCondor transfers the file defined by the
<B>output</B><A NAME="2759"></A> command,
 as well as any other files in the remote scratch directory created by the job,
back to the submit machine only when the job exits on its own.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT</code>: HTCondor behaves the same as described
for the value <code>ON_EXIT</code> when the job exits on its own.
However, if, and each time the job is evicted from a machine,
<I>files are transferred back at eviction time</I>.  The files that
are transferred back at eviction time may include intermediate files
that are not part of the final output of the job.
When <B>transfer_output_files</B><A NAME="2761"></A> is specified,
its list governs which are transferred back at eviction time.
Before the job starts running again, 
all of the files that were stored when the job
was last evicted are copied to the job's new remote scratch
directory.

<P>
The purpose of saving files at eviction time is to allow the job to
resume from where it left off.
This is similar to using the checkpoint feature of the standard universe,
but just specifying <code>ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT</code> is not enough to make a job 
capable of producing or utilizing checkpoints.
The job must be designed to save and restore its state
using the files that are saved at eviction time.

<P>
The files that are transferred back at eviction time are not stored in
the location where the job's final output will be written when the job exits.
HTCondor manages these files automatically,
so usually the only reason for a user to worry about them 
is to make sure that there is enough space to store them.
The files are stored on the submit machine in a temporary directory within the
directory defined by the configuration variable <TT>SPOOL</TT>. 
The directory is named using the <TT>ClusterId</TT> and <TT>ProcId</TT> job
ClassAd attributes.  The directory name takes the form:
<PRE>
   &lt;X mod 10000&gt;/&lt;Y mod 10000&gt;/cluster&lt;X&gt;.proc&lt;Y&gt;.subproc0
</PRE>
where <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> is the value of <TT>ClusterId</TT>, and 
<code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> is the value of <TT>ProcId</TT>. 
As an example, if job 735.0 is evicted, it will produce the directory
<PRE>
   $(SPOOL)/735/0/cluster735.proc0.subproc0
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The default values for these two submit commands make sense as
used together.
If only <B>should_transfer_files</B> is set, 
and set to the value <TT>NO</TT>, 
then no output files will be transferred, and the value of
<B>when_to_transfer_output</B> is irrelevant.
If only <B>when_to_transfer_output</B> is set,
and set to the value <TT>ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT</TT>,
then the default value for an unspecified
<B>should_transfer_files</B> will be <TT>YES</TT>.

<P>
Note that the combination of
<PRE>
  should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED
  when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT
</PRE>
would produce undefined file access semantics.
Therefore, this combination is prohibited by <I>condor_submit</I>.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00354200000000000000">
2.5.4.2 Specifying What Files to Transfer</A>
</H3>

<P>
If the file transfer mechanism is enabled,
HTCondor will transfer the following files before the job
is run on a remote machine.

<OL>
<LI>the executable, as defined with the <B>executable</B><A NAME="2777"></A> command
</LI>
<LI>the input, as defined with the <B>input</B><A NAME="2779"></A> command
</LI>
<LI>any jar files, for the <B>java</B> universe,
  as defined with the <B>jar_files</B><A NAME="2782"></A> command
</LI>
</OL>
If the job requires other input files,
the submit description file should utilize the
<B>transfer_input_files</B><A NAME="2784"></A> command.
This comma-separated list specifies any other files or directories that HTCondor is to
transfer to the remote scratch directory,
to set up the execution environment for the job before it is run.
These files are placed in the same directory as the job's executable.
For example:

<P>
<PRE>
  should_transfer_files = YES
  when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
  transfer_input_files = file1,file2
</PRE>
This example explicitly enables the file transfer mechanism,
and it transfers the executable, the file specified by the <B>input</B>
command, any jar files specified by the <B>jar_files</B> command,
and files <TT>file1</TT> and <TT>file2</TT>.

<P>
If the file transfer mechanism is enabled,
HTCondor will transfer the following files from the execute machine
back to the submit machine after the job exits.

<OL>
<LI>the output file, as defined with the <B>output</B> command
</LI>
<LI>the error file, as defined with the <B>error</B> command
</LI>
<LI>any files created by the job in the remote scratch directory;
this only occurs for jobs other than <B>grid</B>
universe, and for HTCondor-C <B>grid</B> universe jobs;
directories created by the job within the remote scratch directory
are ignored for this automatic detection of files to be transferred.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
A path given for <B>output</B> and <B>error</B> commands represents
a path on the submit machine.  If no path is specified, the directory
specified with <B>initialdir</B><A NAME="2796"></A> is used, and if that is not specified,
the directory from which the job was submitted is used.
At the time the job is submitted, zero-length files are created
on the submit machine, at the given path for the files defined by the  
<B>output</B> and <B>error</B> commands.
This permits job submission failure, if these files cannot be written by
HTCondor.

<P>
To <I>restrict</I> the output files 
or permit entire directory contents to be transferred,
specify the exact list with  <B>transfer_output_files</B><A NAME="2800"></A>.
Delimit the list of file names, directory names, or paths with commas.
When this list is defined, and any of the files or directories
do not exist as the job exits,
HTCondor considers this an error, and places the job on hold.
When this list is defined, automatic detection of output files created by
the job is disabled.
Paths specified in this list refer to locations on the execute
machine.  
The naming and placement of files and directories relies on the
term <I>base name</I>.  
By example, the path <TT>a/b/c</TT> has the base name <TT>c</TT>.
It is the file name or directory name with all directories
leading up to that name stripped off.
On the submit machine, the transferred files or directories
are named using only the base name.
Therefore, each output file or directory must have a different name,
even if they originate from different paths.

<P>
For <B>grid</B> universe jobs other than than HTCondor-C grid jobs,
files to be transferred 
(other than standard output and standard error)
must be specified using <B>transfer_output_files</B>
in the submit description file, because automatic detection of new files
created by the job does not take place.

<P>
Here are examples to promote understanding of what files and
directories are transferred, and how they are named after transfer.
Assume that the job produces the following structure within the
remote scratch directory:
<PRE>
      o1
      o2
      d1 (directory)
          o3
          o4
</PRE>

<P>
If the submit description file sets
<PRE>
   transfer_output_files = o1,o2,d1
</PRE>
then transferred back to the submit machine will be
<PRE>
      o1
      o2
      d1 (directory)
          o3
          o4
</PRE>
Note that the directory <TT>d1</TT> and all its contents are specified,
and therefore transferred.  
If the directory <TT>d1</TT> is not created by the job before exit,
then the job is placed on hold. 
If the directory <TT>d1</TT> is created by the job before exit,
but is empty, this is not an error.

<P>
If, instead, the submit description file sets
<PRE>
   transfer_output_files = o1,o2,d1/o3
</PRE>
then transferred back to the submit machine will be
<PRE>
      o1
      o2
      o3
</PRE>
Note that only the base name is used in the naming and placement
of the file specified with <TT>d1/o3</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00354300000000000000">
2.5.4.3 File Paths for File Transfer</A>
</H3>

<P>
The file transfer mechanism specifies file names and/or paths on
both the file system of the submit machine and on the
file system of the execute machine.
Care must be taken to know which machine, submit or execute,
is utilizing the file name and/or path. 

<P>
Files in the <B>transfer_input_files</B><A NAME="2811"></A> command
are specified as they are accessed on the submit machine.
The job, as it executes, accesses files as they are
found on the execute machine.

<P>
There are three ways to specify files and paths
for <B>transfer_input_files</B><A NAME="2813"></A>:

<OL>
<LI>Relative to the current working directory as the job is submitted,
if the submit command <B>initialdir</B><A NAME="2815"></A> is not specified.
</LI>
<LI>Relative to the initial directory, if the submit command 
<B>initialdir</B><A NAME="2817"></A> is specified.
</LI>
<LI>Absolute.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Before executing the program, HTCondor copies the
executable, an input file as specified
by the submit command <B>input</B><A NAME="2819"></A>,
along with any input files specified 
by <B>transfer_input_files</B><A NAME="2821"></A>.
All these files are placed into
a remote scratch directory on the execute machine,
in which the program runs.
Therefore,
the executing program must access input files relative to its
working directory.
Because all files and directories listed for transfer are placed into a single,
flat directory,
inputs must be uniquely named to
avoid collision when transferred.
A collision causes the last file in the list to
overwrite the earlier one.

<P>
Both relative and absolute paths may be used in
<B>transfer_output_files</B><A NAME="2823"></A>.  Relative paths are relative to
the job's remote scratch directory on the execute machine.
When the files and directories are copied back to the submit machine, they
are placed in the job's initial working directory as the base name of
the original path.  An alternate name or path may be specified by using
<B>transfer_output_remaps</B><A NAME="2825"></A>.

<P>
A job may create files outside the remote scratch directory
but within the file system of the execute machine,
in a directory such as <TT>/tmp</TT>,
if this directory is guaranteed to exist and be
accessible on all possible execute machines.
However,
HTCondor will not automatically
transfer such files back after execution completes, nor will it clean
up these files.

<P>
Here are several examples to illustrate the use of file transfer.
The program executable is called <I>my_program</I>,
and it uses three command-line arguments as it executes: 
two input file names and an output file name.
The program executable and the submit description file 
for this job are located in directory
<TT>/scratch/test</TT>.

2.5.4.4 Behavior for Error Cases</A>
</H3>
This section describes HTCondor's behavior for some error cases
in dealing with the transfer of files.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Disk Full on Execute Machine</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When transferring any files from the submit machine to the remote scratch
  directory,
  if the disk is full on the execute machine,
  then the job is place on hold.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Error Creating Zero-Length Files on Submit Machine</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As a job is submitted, HTCondor creates zero-length files as placeholders
  on the submit machine for the files defined by 
  <B>output</B><A NAME="2856"></A> and <B>error</B><A NAME="2858"></A>.
  If these files cannot be created, then job submission fails.

<P>
This job submission failure avoids having the job run to completion,
  only to be unable to transfer the job's output due to permission errors.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Error When Transferring Files from Execute Machine to Submit Machine</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a job exits, or potentially when a job is evicted from an execute
  machine, one or more files may be transferred from the execute machine
  back to the machine on which the job was submitted.

<P>
During transfer, if any of the following three similar types of errors occur,
  the job is put on hold as the error occurs.
  
<OL>
<LI>If the file cannot be opened on the submit machine, for example
    because the system is out of inodes.
</LI>
<LI>If the file cannot be written on the submit machine, for example
    because the permissions do not permit it.
</LI>
<LI>If the write of the file on the submit machine fails, for example
    because the system is out of disk space.

<BR>
2.5.4.5 File Transfer Using a URL 
</H3>

<P>
Instead of file transfer that goes only between the submit machine
and the execute machine,
HTCondor has the ability to transfer files from a location specified
by a URL for a job's input file,
or from the execute machine to a location specified by a URL
for a job's output file(s).
This capability requires administrative set up, 
as described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_12Setting_Up.html#sec:URL-transfer">3.12.2</A>.

<P>
The transfer of an input file is restricted to
vanilla and vm universe jobs only.
HTCondor's file transfer mechanism must be enabled.
Therefore, the submit description file for the job will define both
<B>should_transfer_files</B><A NAME="2860"></A> and <B>when_to_transfer_output</B><A NAME="2862"></A>.
In addition, the URL for any files specified with a URL are
given in the <B>transfer_input_files</B><A NAME="2864"></A> command.
An example portion of the submit description file for a job
that has a single file specified with a URL:

<P>
<PRE>
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
transfer_input_files = http://www.full.url/path/to/filename
</PRE>
<P>
The destination file is given by the file name within the URL. 

<P>
For the transfer of the entire contents of the output sandbox,
which are all files that the job creates or modifies,
HTCondor's file transfer mechanism must be enabled.
In this sample portion of the submit description file,
the first two commands explicitly enable file transfer,
and the added <B>output_destination</B><A NAME="2866"></A> command provides
both the protocol to be used and the destination of the transfer.
<PRE>
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
output_destination = urltype://path/to/destination/directory
</PRE>Note that with this feature, no files are transferred back to the 
submit machine.  
This does not interfere with the streaming of output. 

<P>
If only a subset of the output sandbox should be transferred,
the subset is specified by further adding a submit command of the form:
<PRE>
transfer_output_files = file1, file2
</PRE>
<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00354600000000000000">
2.5.4.6 Requirements and Rank for File Transfer</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="2563"></A>
The <TT>requirements</TT> expression for a job must depend
on the <code>should_transfer_files</code> command.
The job must specify the correct logic to ensure that the job is matched
with a resource that meets the file transfer needs.
If no <TT>requirements</TT> expression is in the submit description file,
or if the expression specified does not refer to the
attributes listed below, <I>condor_submit</I> adds an
appropriate clause to the <TT>requirements</TT> expression for the job.
<I>condor_submit</I> appends these clauses with a logical AND, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>,
to ensure that the proper conditions are met.
Here are the default clauses corresponding to the different values of
<code>should_transfer_files</code>:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><code>should_transfer_files = YES</code> results in the addition of
the clause <code>(HasFileTransfer)</code>.
  If the job is always going to transfer files, it is required to 
  match with a machine that has the capability to transfer files.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>should_transfer_files = NO</code> results in the addition of
  <code>(TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain)</code>.
  In addition, HTCondor automatically adds the
  <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> attribute to the job ClassAd, with whatever
  string is defined for the <I>condor_schedd</I> to which the job is
  submitted.
  If the job is not using the file transfer mechanism, HTCondor assumes
  it will need a shared file system, and therefore, a machine in the
  same <TT>FileSystemDomain</TT> as the submit machine.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED</code> results in the addition of
<PRE>
  (HasFileTransfer || (TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain))
</PRE>  If HTCondor will optionally transfer files, it must require
  that the machine is <I>either</I> capable of transferring files
  <I>or</I> in the same file system domain.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To ensure that the job is matched to a machine with enough local disk
space to hold all the transferred files, HTCondor automatically adds the
<TT>DiskUsage</TT> job attribute.
This attribute includes the total
size of the job's executable and all input files to be transferred.
HTCondor then adds an additional clause to the <TT>Requirements</TT>
expression that states that the remote machine must have at least
enough available disk space to hold all these files:
<PRE>
  &amp;&amp; (Disk &gt;= DiskUsage)
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="2582"></A>
If <code>should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED</code> and the job prefers
to run on a machine in the local file system domain
over transferring files,
but is still willing to allow the job to run remotely and transfer files,
the <TT>Rank</TT> expression works well.  Use:

<P>
<PRE>
rank = (TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain)
</PRE>
<P>
The <TT>Rank</TT> expression is a floating point value,
so if other items are considered in ranking the possible machines this job
may run on, add the items:

<P>
<PRE>
Rank = kflops + (TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain)
</PRE>
<P>
The value of <TT>kflops</TT> can vary widely among machines,
so this <TT>Rank</TT> expression will likely not do as it intends.
To place emphasis on the job running in the same file system domain,
but still consider floating point speed among the machines 
in the file system domain,
weight the part of the expression that is matching the file system domains.
For example: 

<P>
<PRE>
Rank = kflops + (10000 * (TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain))
</PRE>

HTCondor allows a user to both set and reference environment
variables for a job or job cluster.

<P>
Within a submit description file, the user may define environment
variables for the job's environment by using the 
<B>environment</B> command.
See within the <I>condor_submit</I> manual page at
section&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_submit.html#man-condor-submit-environment">11</A> for more details about this command.

<P>
The submitter's entire environment can be copied into the job
ClassAd for the job at job submission.
The <B>getenv</B><A NAME="2889"></A> command within the submit description file
does this,
as described at section&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_submit.html#man-condor-submit-getenv">11</A>.

<P>
If the environment is set with the <B>environment</B><A NAME="2891"></A> command <I>and</I>

<P>
Commands within the submit description file may reference the
environment variables of the submitter as a job is submitted.
Submit description file commands use <code>$ENV(EnvironmentVariableName)</code>
to reference the value of an environment variable.

<P>
HTCondor sets several additional environment variables for each executing
job that may be useful for the job to reference.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR</TT>
<A NAME="2609"></A>
<A NAME="2610"></A>

when the job stops running on a machine, no matter how the job completes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>_CONDOR_SLOT</TT>
<A NAME="2612"></A>
<A NAME="2613"></A>

If executables are available for the different platforms of machines
in the HTCondor pool,
HTCondor can be allowed the choice of a larger number of machines
when allocating a machine for a job.
Modifications to the submit description file allow this choice
of platforms.

<P>
A simplified example is a cross submission.
An executable is available for one platform, but
the submission is done from a different platform.
Given the correct executable, the <TT>requirements</TT> command in
the submit description file specifies the target architecture.
For example, an executable compiled for a 32-bit Intel processor
running  Windows Vista, submitted
from an Intel architecture running Linux would add the 
<TT>requirement</TT>
<PRE>
  requirements = Arch == "INTEL" &amp;&amp; OpSys == "WINDOWS"
</PRE>
Without this <TT>requirement</TT>, <I>condor_submit</I>
will assume that the program is to be executed on
a machine with the same platform as the machine where the job
is submitted.

See section&nbsp;<A HREF="5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:Grid-Matchmaking">5.3.11</A> for how matchmaking works in the

in a pool, run <I>condor_status</I>.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00356100000000000000">
2.5.6.1 Vanilla Universe Example for Execution on Differing Architectures</A>
</H3> 

<P>
A more complex example of a heterogeneous submission
occurs when a job may be executed on
many different architectures to gain full
use of a diverse architecture and operating system pool.
If the executables are available for the different architectures,
then a modification to the submit description file
will allow HTCondor to choose an executable after an
available machine is chosen.

<P>
A special-purpose Machine Ad substitution macro can be used in
string
attributes in the submit description file.
The macro has the form
<PRE>
  $$(MachineAdAttribute)
</PRE>
The $$() informs HTCondor to substitute the requested 
<TT>MachineAdAttribute</TT> 
from the machine where the job will be executed.

<P>
An example of the heterogeneous job submission
has executables available for two platforms:
RHEL 3 on both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel processors.
This example uses <I>povray</I>
to render images using a popular free rendering engine.

<P>
The substitution macro chooses a specific executable after
a platform for running the job is chosen.
These executables must therefore be named based on the
machine attributes that describe a platform.
The executables named <PRE>
  povray.LINUX.INTEL
  povray.LINUX.X86_64
</PRE>
will work correctly for the macro
<PRE>
  povray.$$(OpSys).$$(Arch)

<P>
The executables or links to executables with this name
are placed into the initial working directory so that they may be
found by HTCondor.

<P>
These jobs are submitted to the vanilla universe
to assure that once a job is started on a specific platform,
it will finish running on that platform.
Switching platforms in the middle of job execution cannot
work correctly.

<P>
There are two common errors made with the substitution macro.
The first is the use of a non-existent <TT>MachineAdAttribute</TT>.
If the specified <TT>MachineAdAttribute</TT> does not
exist in the machine's ClassAd, then HTCondor will place
the job in the held state until the problem is resolved.

<P>
The second common error occurs due to an incomplete job set up.
For example, the submit description file given above specifies
three available executables.
If one is missing, HTCondor reports back that an
executable is missing when it happens to match the
job with a resource that requires the missing binary.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00356200000000000000">
2.5.6.2 Standard Universe Example for Execution on Differing Architectures</A>
</H3> 

<P>
Jobs submitted to the standard universe may produce checkpoints.
A checkpoint can then be used to start up and continue execution
of a partially completed job.
For a partially completed job, the checkpoint and the job are specific
to a platform.
If migrated to a different machine, correct execution requires that
the platform must remain the same.

<P>
In previous versions of HTCondor, the author of the heterogeneous
submission file would need to write extra policy expressions in the
<TT>requirements</TT> expression to force HTCondor to choose the
same type of platform when continuing a checkpointed job.
However, since it is needed in the common case, this
additional policy is now automatically added
to the <TT>requirements</TT> expression.
The additional expression is added
provided the user does not use
<TT>CkptArch</TT> in the <TT>requirements</TT> expression.
HTCondor will remain backward compatible for those users who have explicitly
specified <TT>CkptRequirements</TT>-implying use of <TT>CkptArch</TT>,
in their <TT>requirements</TT> expression.

<P>
The expression added when the attribute <TT>CkptArch</TT> is not specified 
will default to

<P>
<PRE>
  # Added by HTCondor
  CkptRequirements = ((CkptArch == Arch) || (CkptArch =?= UNDEFINED)) &amp;&amp; \
                      ((CkptOpSys == OpSys) || (CkptOpSys =?= UNDEFINED))

  Requirements = (&lt;user specified policy&gt;) &amp;&amp; $(CkptRequirements)
</PRE>
<P>
The behavior of the <TT>CkptRequirements</TT> expressions and its addition to
<TT>requirements</TT> is as follows.
The <TT>CkptRequirements</TT> expression guarantees correct operation
in the two possible cases for a job.
In the first case, the job has not produced a checkpoint.
The ClassAd attributes <TT>CkptArch</TT> and <TT>CkptOpSys</TT>
will be undefined, and therefore the meta operator (<code>=?=</code>)
evaluates to true.
In the second case, the job has produced a checkpoint.
The Machine ClassAd is restricted to require further execution
only on a machine of the same platform.
The attributes <TT>CkptArch</TT> and <TT>CkptOpSys</TT>
will be defined, ensuring that the platform chosen for further
execution will be the same as the one used just before the
checkpoint.

<P>
Note that this restriction of platforms also applies to platforms where
the executables are binary compatible.

2.5.7 Jobs That Require GPUs
</H2>
A job that needs GPUs to run identifies the number of GPUs needed
in the submit description file by adding the submit command
<PRE>
  request_GPUs = &lt;n&gt;
</PRE>
where <TT>&lt;n&gt;</TT> is replaced by the integer quantity of GPUs required
for the job.
For example, a job that needs 1 GPU uses
<PRE>
  request_GPUs = 1
</PRE>

<P>
Because there are different capabilities among GPUs, 
the job might need to further qualify which GPU of available ones
is required.
Do this by specifying or adding a clause to an existing 
<B>Requirements</B><A NAME="2958"></A> submit command.
As an example, 
assume that the job needs a speed and capacity of a CUDA GPU
that meets or exceeds the value 1.2.
In the submit description file, place
<PRE>
  request_GPUs = 1
  requirements = (CUDACapability &gt;= 1.2) &amp;&amp; $(requirements:True)
</PRE>

<P>
Access to GPU resources by an HTCondor job needs special configuration
of the machines that offer GPUs.
Details of how to set up the configuration are in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_5Policy_Configuration.html#sec:GPU-resources">3.5.10</A>.

2.5.8 Interactive Jobs
</H2>

<P>
An <I>interactive job</I> is a Condor job that is provisioned and
scheduled like any other vanilla universe Condor job 
onto an execute machine within the pool.
The result of a running interactive job is a shell prompt 
issued on the execute machine where the job runs.
The user that submitted the interactive job may then use the
shell as desired,
perhaps to interactively run an instance of what is to become
a Condor job.
This might aid in checking that the set up and execution
environment are correct,
or it might provide information on the RAM or disk space needed.
This job (shell) continues until the user logs out or any other
policy implementation causes the job to stop running.
A useful feature of the interactive job is that the users and jobs
are accounted for within Condor's scheduling and priority system.

<P>
Neither the submit nor the execute host for interactive
jobs may be on Windows platforms. 

<P>
The current working directory of the shell will be the
initial working directory of the running job.
The shell type will be the default for the user that submits
the job.
At the shell prompt, X11 forwarding is enabled.

<P>
Each interactive job will have a job ClassAd attribute of 
<PRE>
  InteractiveJob = True
</PRE>

<P>
Submission of an interactive job specifies the option <B>-interactive</B>
on the <I>condor_submit</I> command line.

<P>
A submit description file may be specified for this interactive job.
Within this submit description file, 
a specification of these 5 commands will be either ignored or altered:

<OL>
<LI><B>executable</B><A NAME="3340"></A>
</LI>
<LI><B>transfer_executable</B><A NAME="3342"></A>
</LI>
<LI><B>arguments</B><A NAME="3344"></A>
</LI>
<LI><B>universe</B><A NAME="3346"></A>.  The interactive job is a vanilla universe job. 
</LI>
<LI><B>queue</B><A NAME="3348"></A> <B>&lt;n&gt;</B>.  In this case the value of <B>&lt;n&gt;</B> is
ignored; exactly one interactive job is queued.
</LI>
</OL>
The submit description file may specify anything else needed for
the interactive job, such as files to transfer.

<P>
If <I>no</I> submit description file is specified for the job,
a default one is utilized as identified by the value of the
configuration variable <TT>INTERACTIVE_SUBMIT_FILE</TT><A NAME="3352"></A><A NAME="3353"></A>.

<P>
Here are examples of situations where interactive jobs may be
of benefit.

<UL>
<LI>An application that cannot be batch processed might be run
as an interactive job.
Where input or output cannot be captured in a file and the
executable may not be modified,
the interactive nature of the job may still be run on a pool
machine, and within the purview of Condor.
</LI>
<LI>A pool machine with specialized hardware that requires
interactive handling can be scheduled with an interactive
job that utilizes the hardware.
</LI>
<LI>The debugging and set up of complex jobs or environments
may benefit from an interactive session.
This interactive session provides the opportunity to run scripts 
or applications, 
and as errors are identified, 
they can be corrected on the spot.
</LI>
<LI>Development may have an interactive nature,
and proceed more quickly when done on a pool machine.
It may also be that the development platforms required
reside within Condor's purview as execute hosts. 
</LI>
</UL>
