</H2>

The HTCondor daemons do not run authenticated to AFS; they do not possess
AFS tokens.
Therefore, no child process of HTCondor will be AFS authenticated.
The implication of this is that you must set file permissions so
that your job can access any necessary files residing on an AFS volume
without relying on having your AFS permissions.

<P>
If a job you submit to HTCondor needs to access files residing in AFS,
you have the following choices:

<OL>
<LI>Copy the needed files from AFS to either a local hard disk where 
HTCondor can access them using remote system calls (if
this is a standard universe job), or copy them to an NFS volume.
</LI>
<LI>If the files must be kept on AFS, then set a host ACL
(using the AFS <I>fs setacl</I> command) on the subdirectory to
serve as the current working directory for the job.
If this is a standard universe job, then the host ACL needs
to give read/write permission to any process on the submit machine.
If this is a vanilla universe job, then set the ACL such that any host 
in the pool can access the files without being authenticated.
If you do not know how to use an AFS host ACL, ask the person at your 
site responsible for the AFS configuration.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The Center for High Throughput Computing hopes to improve upon how 
HTCondor deals with AFS 
authentication in a subsequent release.

<P>
Please see section&nbsp;<A HREF="3_12Setting_Up.html#sec:HTCondor-AFS">3.12.1</A> for
further discussion of this problem.

<A NAME="9113"></A>
If the current working directory when a job is submitted
is accessed via an NFS automounter, HTCondor may have problems if the
automounter later decides to unmount the volume before the job has
completed.
This is because <I>condor_submit</I> likely has stored the
dynamic mount point as the job's initial current working directory, and
this mount point could become automatically unmounted by the
automounter.

<P>
There is a simple work around.
When submitting the job,
use the submit command <B>initialdir</B><A NAME="9244"></A> to point to
the stable access point.
For example,
suppose the NFS automounter is configured to mount a volume at mount point
<TT>/a/myserver.company.com/vol1/johndoe</TT>
whenever the directory <TT>/home/johndoe</TT> is accessed.
Adding the following line to the
submit description file solves the problem.
<PRE>
  initialdir = /home/johndoe
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="9120"></A>
<A NAME="9121"></A>
HTCondor attempts to flush the NFS cache on a submit machine in order to
refresh a job's initial working directory.
This allows files written by the job into an NFS mounted 
initial working directory to be immediately visible on the submit machine.
Since the flush operation can require multiple round trips
to the NFS server, it is expensive.
Therefore, a job may disable the flushing by setting
<PRE>
  +IwdFlushNFSCache = False
</PRE>
in the job's submit description file.
See page&nbsp;<A HREF="12_Appendix_A.html#IwdFlushNFSCache-job-attribute"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for a definition
of the job ClassAd attribute.

2.13.3 HTCondor Daemons That Do Not Run as root</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="9126"></A>
<A NAME="9127"></A>
HTCondor is normally installed such that the HTCondor daemons have root
permission.
This allows HTCondor to run the <I>condor_shadow</I> 
<A NAME="9129"></A>
<A NAME="9130"></A>
daemon and
the job with the submitting user's UID and file access rights.
When HTCondor
is started as root, HTCondor jobs can access whatever files the
user that submits the jobs can.

<P>
However, it is possible that the HTCondor installation 
does not have root access, or
has decided not to run the daemons as root.
That is unfortunate,
since HTCondor is designed to be run as root.
To see if HTCondor is
running as root on a specific machine, use the command
<PRE>
  condor_status -master -l &lt;machine-name&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
where <code>&lt;machine-name&gt;</code> is the name of the specified machine.
This command displays the full condor_master ClassAd; if the
attribute <TT>RealUid</TT> equals zero,
then the HTCondor daemons are indeed
running with root access.  If the
<TT>RealUid</TT> attribute is not zero, then the HTCondor daemons do not have
root access.

<P>
<U>NOTE</U>: The Unix program <I>ps</I>
is <I>not</I> an effective
method of determining if HTCondor is running with root access.
When using <I>ps</I>,
it may often appear that the daemons are
running as the condor user instead of root.
However, note that the <I>ps</I>
command shows the current <I>effective</I> owner of the
process, not the <I>real</I> owner.  (See the <I>getuid</I>(2) and
<I>geteuid</I>(2) Unix man pages for details.)  In Unix, a process
running under the real UID of root may switch its effective UID.
(See the <I>seteuid</I>(2) man page.)
For security reasons, the daemons
only set the effective UID to root when absolutely necessary,
as it will be to perform a privileged operation.

<P>
If daemons are not running with root access, 
make any and all files
and/or directories that the job will touch readable and/or writable by
the UID (user id) specified by the <TT>RealUid</TT> attribute.
Often this may
mean using the Unix command <code>chmod 777</code>
on the directory from which the HTCondor job is submitted.

2.13.4 Job Leases
</H2>

<P>
A <I>job lease</I> specifies how long a given job will attempt to run
on a remote resource,
even if that resource loses contact with the submitting machine.
Similarly, it is the length of time the submitting machine will
spend trying to reconnect to the (now disconnected) execution host,
before the submitting machine gives up and tries to claim
another resource to run the job.
The goal aims at run only once semantics,
so that the <I>condor_schedd</I> daemon does not allow the same job
to run on multiple sites simultaneously.

<P>
If the submitting machine is alive,
it periodically renews the job lease,
and all is well.
If the submitting machine is dead,
or the network goes down, the job lease will no longer be renewed.
Eventually the lease expires.
While the lease has not expired,
the execute host continues to try to run the job,
in the hope that the submit machine will come back to life
and reconnect.
If the job completes and the lease has not expired, yet the 
submitting machine is still dead,
the <I>condor_starter</I> daemon will wait for a
<I>condor_shadow</I> daemon to reconnect, 
before sending final information on the job,
and its output files.
Should the lease expire, the <I>condor_startd</I> daemon
kills off the <I>condor_starter</I> daemon and user job.

<P>
<A NAME="9157"></A>
<A NAME="9158"></A>
A default value equal to 20 minutes exists for a job's
ClassAd attribute <TT>JobLeaseDuration</TT>, 
or this attribute may be set in the submit description file,
using <B>job_lease_duration</B><A NAME="9273"></A>,
to keep a job running in the case that the submit side no longer
renews the lease.
There is a trade off in setting the value of <B>job_lease_duration</B><A NAME="9275"></A>. 
Too small a value,
and the job might get killed before the submitting machine has a
chance to recover.
Forward progress on the job will be lost.
Too large a value,
and an execute resource will be tied up waiting for the job lease to expire.
The value should be chosen based on how long the user is willing to tie up
the execute machines, how quickly submit machines come  back up,
and how much work would be lost if the lease expires,
the job is killed, and the job must start over from its beginning.

<P>
As a special case, a submit description file setting of
<PRE>
 job_lease_duration = 0
</PRE>
as well as utilizing submission other than <I>condor_submit</I>
that do not set <TT>JobLeaseDuration</TT>
(such as using the web services interface)
results in the corresponding job ClassAd attribute to be explicitly
undefined.
This has the further effect of changing the duration of a claim lease,
the amount of time that the execution machine waits before
dropping a claim due to missing keep alive messages.
