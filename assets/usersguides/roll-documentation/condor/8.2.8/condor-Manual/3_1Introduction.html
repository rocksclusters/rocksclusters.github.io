3.1 Introduction
</H1>

<P>
This is the HTCondor Administrator's Manual.
Its purpose is to aid in
the installation and administration of an HTCondor pool.  For help on
using HTCondor, see the HTCondor User's Manual.  

<P>
An HTCondor pool
<A NAME="9484"></A>
<A NAME="9485"></A>
is comprised of a single machine which serves as the
<I>central manager</I>,
<A NAME="9487"></A>
and an arbitrary number of other machines that
have joined the pool.  Conceptually, the pool is a collection of
resources (machines) and resource requests (jobs).  The role of HTCondor
is to match waiting requests with available resources.  Every part of
HTCondor sends periodic updates to the central manager, the centralized
repository of information about the state of the pool.  Periodically,
the central manager assesses the current state of the pool and tries
to match pending requests with the appropriate resources.  

<P>
Each resource has an owner,
<A NAME="9488"></A>
<A NAME="9489"></A>
the one who sets the policy for the use of the machine.  This
person has absolute power over the use of the machine,
and HTCondor goes out
of its way to minimize the impact on this owner caused by HTCondor.  It
is up to the resource owner to define a policy for when HTCondor
requests will
serviced and when they will be denied.

<P>
Each resource request has an owner as well: the
user who submitted the job.  These people want HTCondor to provide as
many CPU cycles as possible for their work.  Often the interests of
the resource owners are in conflict with the interests of the resource
requesters.  
The job of the HTCondor administrator is to configure the HTCondor pool to
find the happy medium that keeps both resource owners and users of
resources satisfied.  The purpose of this manual is to relate
the mechanisms that HTCondor provides to enable the administrator to find
this happy medium.

<P>

<BR>
3.1.1 The Different Roles a Machine Can Play
</H2>

<P>
Every machine in an HTCondor pool can serve a variety of roles.  Most
machines serve more than one role simultaneously.  Certain roles can
only be performed by a single machine in the pool.  The following list
describes what these roles are and what resources are required on the
machine that is providing that service:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<A NAME="9492"></A>
<A NAME="9493"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Central Manager</STRONG></DT>
<DD>There can be only one central manager for the pool.
This machine is the collector of information, and the negotiator
between resources and resource requests.  These two halves of the
central manager's responsibility are performed by separate daemons, so
it would be possible to have different machines providing those two
services.  However, normally they both live on the same machine.  This
machine plays a very important part in the HTCondor pool and should be
reliable.  If this machine crashes, no further matchmaking can be
performed within the HTCondor system,
although all current matches remain in effect until they are broken 
by either party involved in the match.
Therefore, choose for central manager
a machine that is likely to be up and running all the time, 
or at least one that will be rebooted quickly if something goes wrong.
The central manager will
ideally have a good network connection to all the
machines in the pool, since these pool machines all send updates over 
the network to the central manager. 

<P>
<A NAME="9494"></A>
<A NAME="9495"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Execute</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Any machine in the pool, 
including the central manager, 
can be configured as to whether or not it should execute HTCondor jobs.
Obviously, some of the machines will have to serve this
function, or the pool will not be useful.
Being an execute machine does not require lots of resources.  
About the only resource that might matter is disk space.
In general the
more resources a machine has in terms of swap space, memory, number of CPUs, 
the larger variety of resource requests it can serve.

<P>
<A NAME="9496"></A>
<A NAME="9497"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Submit</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Any machine in the pool,
including the central manager,
can be configured as to whether or not it should allow HTCondor
jobs to be submitted.
The resource requirements for a submit machine
are actually much greater than the resource requirements for an
execute machine.  First, every submitted job that is
currently running on a remote machine runs a process on
the submit machine.  
As a result, lots of running jobs
will need a fair amount of swap space and/or real memory.
In addition,
the checkpoint files from standard universe jobs are stored on 
the local disk of the submit machine.
If these jobs have a large
memory image and there are a lot of them, 
the submit machine will need a lot of disk space to hold these files.
This disk space requirement can be
somewhat alleviated by using a checkpoint server,
however the binaries of the jobs are still stored on the submit machine.

<P>
<A NAME="9498"></A>
<A NAME="9499"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Checkpoint Server</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Machines in the pool can be configured to act as
checkpoint servers.
This is optional, and is not part of the
standard HTCondor binary distribution.  A checkpoint server is a
machine that stores checkpoint files for sets of jobs.
A machine with this role should have lots of disk space
and a good network connection to the rest of the pool, as the traffic
can be quite heavy.

3.1.2 The HTCondor Daemons
</H2>

<P>
The following list describes all the daemons and programs that could
be started under HTCondor and what they do:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<A NAME="9645"></A>
<A NAME="9646"></A>
<A NAME="9507"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_master</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
is responsible for keeping all the
rest of the HTCondor daemons running on each machine in the pool.  It
spawns the other daemons, and it periodically checks to see if there are
new binaries installed for any of them.  If there are, the 
<I>condor_master</I> daemon will
restart the affected daemons.  In addition, if any daemon crashes, the
<I>condor_master</I> will send e-mail to the HTCondor administrator of the pool and
restart the daemon.  The <I>condor_master</I> also supports various
administrative commands that enable the administrator to start, 
stop or reconfigure daemons remotely.  
The <I>condor_master</I> will run on every machine in
the pool, regardless of the functions that each machine is performing.  

<P>
<A NAME="9647"></A>
<A NAME="9648"></A>
<A NAME="9515"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_startd</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
represents a given resource to the HTCondor pool,  
as a machine capable of running jobs. 
It advertises certain attributes about machine that are used to
match it with pending resource requests.  
The <I>condor_startd</I> will run on any
machine in the pool that is to be able to execute jobs.  
It is responsible for enforcing the policy that the resource owner configures,
which determines under what conditions jobs will be started,
suspended, resumed, vacated, or killed.
When the <I>condor_startd</I> is ready to
execute an HTCondor job, it spawns the <I>condor_starter</I>.

<P>
<A NAME="9649"></A>
<A NAME="9650"></A>
<A NAME="9522"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_starter</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
is the entity that actually
spawns the HTCondor job on a given machine.  It sets up the
execution environment and monitors the job once it is running.  When a
job completes, the <I>condor_starter</I> notices this, sends back any status
information to the submitting machine, and exits.

<P>
<A NAME="9651"></A>
<A NAME="9652"></A>
<A NAME="9527"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_schedd</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
represents resource requests to
the HTCondor pool.  Any machine that is to be a submit machine
needs to have a <I>condor_schedd</I> running.  
When users submit jobs, 
the jobs go to the <I>condor_schedd</I>, where they are stored in the 
<I>job queue</I>.
The <I>condor_schedd</I> manages the job queue.
Various tools to view and
manipulate the job queue,
such as <I>condor_submit</I>, <I>condor_q</I>, and <I>condor_rm</I>,
all must connect to the <I>condor_schedd</I> to do their work.  If the
<I>condor_schedd</I> is not running on a given machine, 
none of these commands will work.  

<P>
The <I>condor_schedd</I> advertises the number of waiting jobs in its job queue and
is responsible for claiming available resources to serve those requests.  
Once a job has been matched with a given resource, the
<I>condor_schedd</I> spawns a <I>condor_shadow</I> daemon to serve that
particular request.

<P>
<A NAME="9653"></A>
<A NAME="9654"></A>
<A NAME="9543"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_shadow</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
runs on the machine where a given
request was submitted and acts as the resource manager for the
request.  Jobs that are linked for HTCondor's standard universe, which
perform remote system calls, do so via the <I>condor_shadow</I>.  Any
system call performed on the remote execute machine is sent over the
network, back to the <I>condor_shadow</I> which performs the
system call on the submit machine, and the result
is sent back over the network to the job on the execute machine.
In addition, 
the <I>condor_shadow</I> is responsible for making decisions about the request,
such as where checkpoint files should be stored, 
and how certain files should be accessed.  

<P>
<A NAME="9655"></A>
<A NAME="9656"></A>
<A NAME="9550"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_collector</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
is responsible for collecting
all the information about the status of an HTCondor pool.  All other
daemons periodically send ClassAd updates to
the <I>condor_collector</I>.  These ClassAds contain all the information about the
state of the daemons, the resources they represent or resource
requests in the pool.
The <I>condor_status</I> command can be used to query the
<I>condor_collector</I> for specific information about various parts of HTCondor.  
In addition, the HTCondor daemons themselves query the <I>condor_collector</I> for
important information, such as what address to use for sending
commands to a remote machine. 

<P>
<A NAME="9657"></A>
<A NAME="9658"></A>
<A NAME="9558"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_negotiator</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
is responsible for all the match making within the HTCondor system.  
Periodically, the <I>condor_negotiator</I>
begins a <I>negotiation cycle</I>, where it queries the 
<I>condor_collector</I> for
the current state of all the resources in the pool.  It contacts each
<I>condor_schedd</I> that has waiting resource requests in priority order, 
and tries to match available resources with those requests.
The <I>condor_negotiator</I> is
responsible for enforcing user priorities in the system, where the
more resources a given user has claimed, the less priority they have
to acquire more resources.  If a user with a better priority has jobs
that are waiting to run, and resources are claimed by a user with a
worse priority, the <I>condor_negotiator</I> can preempt that resource and match it
with the user with better priority.

<P>
<U>NOTE</U>: A higher numerical value of the user priority in HTCondor
translate into worse priority for that user.  The best priority 
is 0.5, the lowest numerical value, and this priority gets
worse as this number grows.

<A NAME="9660"></A>
<A NAME="9568"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_kbdd</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
is used on both Linux and Windows platforms.
On those platforms, the <I>condor_startd</I> frequently cannot determine
console (keyboard or mouse) activity directly from the system, and
requires a separate process to do so.
On Linux, the
<I>condor_kbdd</I> connects to the X Server and periodically checks to see
if there has been any activity.
On Windows, the <I>condor_kbdd</I> runs as the logged-in user and registers
with the system to receive keyboard and mouse events.
When it detects console activity, the <I>condor_kbdd</I> sends a
command to the <I>condor_startd</I>.  
That way, the <I>condor_startd</I> knows the machine owner
is using the machine again and can perform whatever actions are
necessary, given the policy it has been configured to enforce.

<A NAME="9662"></A>
<A NAME="9578"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_ckpt_server</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>The checkpoint server
services requests to store and retrieve checkpoint files.  
If the pool is configured to use a checkpoint server,
but that machine or the server itself is down,
HTCondor will revert to sending the checkpoint
files for a given job back to the submit machine.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>condor_gridmanager</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
handles management and execution of all <B>grid</B>
universe jobs.
The <I>condor_schedd</I> invokes the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> when
there are <B>grid</B> universe jobs in the queue,
and the <I>condor_gridmanager</I> exits when there are no more
<B>grid</B> universe jobs in the queue.

<DT><STRONG><I>condor_had</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This daemon
implements the high availability of a pool's central manager
