2.7 Priorities and Preemption
</H1>

<P>
HTCondor has two independent priority controls: <I>job</I>
priorities and <I>user</I> priorities.  

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00371000000000000000">
2.7.1 Job Priority</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="3621"></A>
<A NAME="3622"></A>
Job priorities allow a user to assign a priority level to
each of their own submitted HTCondor jobs,
in order to control the order of job execution.
This handles the situation in which a user has more jobs
queued, waiting to be executed, than there are machines available.
Setting a job priority identifies the ordering in which 
that user's jobs are executed; a higher job priority job is matched and
executed before a lower priority job.
A job priority can be any integer, and larger values are of higher priority.
So, 0 is a higher job priority than -3,
and 6 is a higher job priority than 5.

<P>
<A NAME="3623"></A>
For the simple case, each job can be given a distinct priority.
For an already queued job, 
its priority may be set with the <I>condor_prio</I> command;
see the example in section&nbsp;<A HREF="2_6Managing_Job.html#sec:job-prio">2.6.4</A>, or the
<I>condor_prio</I> manual page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_prio.html#man-condor-prio"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for details.
This sets the value of job ClassAd attribute <TT>JobPrio</TT>. 

<P>
A fine-grained categorization of jobs and their ordering
is available for experts by using the job ClassAd attributes:
<TT>PreJobPrio1</TT>,
<TT>PreJobPrio2</TT>,
<TT>JobPrio</TT>,
<TT>PostJobPrio1</TT>, or
<TT>PostJobPrio2</TT>.

2.7.2 User priority
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="3635"></A>
<A NAME="3636"></A>
<A NAME="3637"></A>
Machines are allocated to users based upon a user's priority.
A lower numerical value for user priority means higher priority,
so a user with priority 5 will get more resources than
a user with priority 50.
User priorities in HTCondor can be examined with the <I>condor_userprio</I>
command (see page&nbsp;<A HREF="condor_userprio.html#man-condor-userprio"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>).
<A NAME="3640"></A>
HTCondor administrators can set and change individual user priorities
with the same utility.

<P>
HTCondor continuously calculates the share of available machines that each
user should be allocated.    This share is inversely related to the ratio
between user priorities.
For example, a user with a priority of 10 will get twice as many
machines as a user with a priority of 20.
The priority of each individual user changes according to
the number of resources the individual is using.
Each user starts out with the best possible priority: 0.5.
If the number of machines a user currently has is greater than 
the user priority,
the user priority will worsen by numerically increasing over time.
If the number of machines is less then the priority,
the priority will improve by numerically decreasing over time. 
The long-term result is fair-share access across all users.
The speed at which HTCondor adjusts the priorities is
controlled with the configuration variable <TT>PRIORITY_HALFLIFE</TT><A NAME="3915"></A><A NAME="3916"></A>,
an exponential half-life value.
The default is one day.
If a user that has user priority of 100 and is
utilizing 100 machines removes all his/her jobs,
one day later that user's
priority will be 50, and two days later the priority will be 25.

<P>
HTCondor enforces that each user gets his/her fair share of machines
according to user priority both when allocating machines which become
available and by priority preemption of currently allocated machines.
For instance, if a low priority user is utilizing all available machines
and suddenly a higher priority user submits jobs, HTCondor will
immediately take a checkpoint and vacate jobs belonging to the lower priority
user. This will free up machines that HTCondor will then give over to the
higher priority user. HTCondor will not starve the lower priority user; it
will preempt only enough jobs so that the higher priority user's fair
share can be realized (based upon the ratio between user priorities). To
prevent thrashing of the system due to priority preemption, the HTCondor 
site administrator can define a <TT>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</TT><A NAME="3920"></A><A NAME="3921"></A> expression in HTCondor's configuration.
The default expression that ships with HTCondor is configured to only preempt 
lower priority jobs that have run
for at least one hour. So in the previous example, in the worse case it
could take up to a maximum of one hour until the higher priority user
receives a fair share of machines.
For a general discussion of
limiting preemption,
please see
section <A HREF="#sec:Disabling_Preemption"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> of the Administrator's manual.

<P>
User priorities are keyed on <TT>&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;</TT>, for example
<TT>johndoe@cs.wisc.edu</TT>. The domain name to use, if any, is configured by
the HTCondor site administrator.  Thus, user priority and therefore resource
allocation is not impacted by which machine the user submits from or
even if the user submits jobs from multiple machines.

<P>
<A NAME="3646"></A>
<A NAME="3647"></A>
An extra feature is the ability to submit a job as
a <I>nice</I> job (see page&nbsp;<A HREF="#man-condor-submit-nice"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>).
Nice jobs artificially boost the user priority 
by ten million just for the nice job.
This effectively means that nice jobs will only run on
machines that no other HTCondor job (that is, non-niced job) wants.
In a similar fashion, an HTCondor administrator could set
the user priority of any specific HTCondor user very high.
If done, for example, with a guest account,
the guest could only use cycles not wanted by other users of the system.

2.7.3 Details About How HTCondor Jobs Vacate Machines
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="3651"></A>
<A NAME="3652"></A>
When HTCondor needs a job to vacate a machine for whatever reason, it
sends the job an asynchronous signal specified in the <TT>KillSig</TT>
attribute of the job's ClassAd.
The value of this attribute can be specified by
the user at submit time by placing the <B>kill_sig</B> option in the
HTCondor submit description file.  

<P>
If a program wanted to do some special work when required
to vacate a machine, the program may set up a
signal handler to use a trappable signal as an indication
to clean up.
When submitting this job, this clean up signal is specified to be used with
<B>kill_sig</B>.
Note that the clean up work needs to be quick.
If the job takes too long to go away, HTCondor
follows up with a SIGKILL signal which immediately terminates the
process.

<P>
<A NAME="3656"></A>
A job that is linked using <I>condor_compile</I>
and is subsequently submitted into the standard universe, 
will checkpoint and exit upon receipt of a SIGTSTP signal.
Thus, SIGTSTP is
the default value for <TT>KillSig</TT> when submitting to the standard
universe.
The user's code may still checkpoint itself at any time
by calling one of the following functions exported by the HTCondor libraries:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>ckpt()()</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Performs a checkpoint and then returns.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>ckpt_and_exit()()</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Checkpoints and exits; HTCondor will then
restart the process again later, potentially on a different machine.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
For jobs submitted into the vanilla universe, the default value for
<TT>KillSig</TT> is SIGTERM,
the usual method to nicely terminate a Unix program.
