	could see the error message:
	</P
><P

CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>	411-alert: error while loading shared libraries: librocks.so: cannot
	open shared object file: No such file or directory
	</SAMP
>
	</P
><P
>	This occurs when 'ldconfig' is not run during the post installation.
	The fix is to ensure ldconfig is run at the end of an installation
	for all nodes.

>	Fixes to the Rocks Command Line and 411-master program to fully support
	channel bonding on the frontend.

>	When only one alias was specified for a host (with the command:
	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>rocks add host alias</SAMP
>), the entry
	in <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>/var/named/private.domain</SAMP
> would
	have the format similar to
	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>compute-1-0 CNAME ('c1-0',)</SAMP
>.
	</P

	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>compute-1-0 CNAME c1-0</SAMP
>.
	</P

><P
>	Clients were unable to use the Rocks Command Line.
	This was because a file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d was not installed on
	the clients that allowed mysql client code to find its libraries.
	</P
><P
>	Clients can now run Rocks Command Line commands.
	</P

><P
>	The ability to build a "login appliance" was only available when the
	SGE Roll was supplied.
	</P
><P
>	The login appliance configuration logic has been moved into the Base
	Roll, so now one can build login appliances on any Rocks clusters.

	file systems.

	be reformatted on subsequent installations.

>	Increase installation speeds for clients with software RAID file
	systems.
	</P
><P
>	Prior to this fix, if one of the partitions is a software RAID and if
	the raid is in a "dirty" state, mdadm will try to 'resync' the disks
	to ensure all the data is protected. On a running system, this is a
	great thing to do. On an installing system, it slows the install down
	considerably.
	</P
><P
>	We didn't find a way to disable the 'resync' action for mdadm, but we
	can extremely throttle back the top rebuild speed by executing:

>	There was a code in rocks-tracker that wasn't properly reconstructing
	the 'peers' circular list when that list was expanded.
	This could cause several MD5 checksum errors on installing nodes
	because an installing node would ask for a peer and the tracker would
	send stale peer data to the installing node.

	the messages exchanged between the tracker-server and the

	nodes were incapable of finding (and thus, incapaable of downloading)
	their packages.
