>The licensing of the wxWidgets library is intended to protect the wxWidgets
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the wxWidgets Licence, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWidgets source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWidgets library source code in the way
intended.

The wxWidgets Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWidgets library contains files
under two different licences:

- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
  Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
  terms.

- Most core wxWidgets manuals are made available under the "wxWidgets
  Free Documentation Licence", which allows you to distribute modified
  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
  manuals.

Other relevant files:

- licence.txt: a statement that the wxWidgets library is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public Licence, with an
  exception notice for binary distribution.

- licendoc.txt: the wxWidgets Documentation Licence.

- lgpl.txt: the text of the GNU Library General Public Licence.

- gpl.txt: the text of the GNU General Public Licence, which is
  referenced by the LGPL.</PRE
