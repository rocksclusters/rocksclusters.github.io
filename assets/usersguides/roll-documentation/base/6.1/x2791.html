>Redesign of the Avalanche Installer.</P
><P
>	While observing the performance of the Avalanche Installer on a
	1000-node machine, it became obvious that we must reduce as much
	traffic to the frontend as possible.
	This led to replacing the python BitTorrent-based installer with a
	BitTorrent-inspired installer written in C.
	The C code allows us to put more files into the peer-to-peer network,
	most notably: product.img (160KB), stage2.img (108MB) and
	updates.img (98MB).
	</P
><P
>	To further reduce traffic to the frontend, the frontend now sends
	package predictions to installing nodes.
	When a node asks for a package, the tracker on the frontend sends
	a list of node addresses where that package can be found, plus a list of
	the next 9 packages that node will most likely ask for next.
	When similar appliances are concurrently installing, this reduces
	tracker traffic by 10x.
	</P
><P
>	Installing nodes can be grouped.
	When an installing node asks the tracker for the location of a package
	and if other nodes are concurrently installing, the tracker will
	favor nodes that are in the same group as the requesting node, that
	is, the list the tracker sends back to the installing node will have
	nodes from the same group as the installing node at the top of the list.
	The default grouping is by rack, but it can be controlled by the "coop"
	attribute.
	For example, if you would like to put all nodes from rack 0 and rack 1
	in the same group (named "red"), you would execute: "rocks set host
	attr rack0 rack1 coop red".
	</P
><P
>	One can specify multiple trackers and multiple "package servers".
	A package server is a node that is "guaranteed" to have the
	requested file (e.g., the frontend).
	</P
><P
>	For every downloaded file, an MD5 checksum verification is performed.
	This detects the case where a peer may have corrupted a file and 
	prevents the corrupted file from spreading into the
	peer-to-peer network.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Channel bonding for nodes is now controlled by the Rocks command
	line.</P
><P
>	Channel bonding configuration for a node is stored in the database
	and can be added, removed or modified with the Rocks command line
	(e.g., "rocks add host bonded ...").
	After channel bonding is configured for a node, it can be dynamically
	applied by executing "rocks sync host network ...".
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>All nodes' firewall rules are controlled by the Rocks command
	line.</P
><P
>	The rules for all the nodes are stored in the database and can be added,
	removed or modified with the Rocks command line (e.g., "rocks open
	host firewall", "rocks close host firewall", "rocks remove host
	firewall").
	After a node's firewall settings are changed, they can be applied to
	the node on-the-fly with "rocks sync host firewall 'hostname'"
	(this command is also called when the user executes
	"rocks sync host network ...").
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Introduction of "Air Traffic Control".</P
><P
>	We've developed a service known as the "Airboss" that resides on the
	physical frontend (in Dom0) and it allows non-root users to control
	their VMs.
	The motivation for this service is that libvirt (a virtualization API
	written by RedHat that can control several different virtualization
	implementations) assumes "root" access to control and monitor VMs.
	</P
><P
>	The Airboss in Rocks is a small service that uses digitally signed
	messages to give non-root users access to their virtual cluster (and
	only their virtual cluster).
	The Airboss relies upon public/private key pairs to validate messages.
	The administrator of the physical hosting cluster must issue a single
	command to associate a public key with a particular virtual cluster.
	At that point, the full process of powering up, powering down and
	installing a virtual
	cluster can be controlled by the (authorized) non-root user.
	</P
><P
>	In addition to VM power control, we've also added the ability to
	attach to a VM's console.
	This allows users to see the entire boot sequence for a VM starting
	from the "BIOS" boot messages.
	</P
><P
>	Several Rocks commands were added to support this feature:
	"rocks create keys" (to create public/private key pairs),
	"rocks set host power" (to power up/down VMs and to forcibly install
	a VM, akin to PXE booting a physical machine), and
	"rocks open host console" (to attach to a VM's console).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"greceptor" replaced with "channeld".</P
><P
>	The wire protocol for Ganglia messages changed which required a
	major overhaul to greceptor. We made the decision to write a simple
	RPC-based service (named 'channeld') to take over the responsibilities
	of greceptor. Channeld accepts 411-put requests and acts on them by
	using 411-get to download files under the control of 411.
	</P
><P
>	All other components of 411 remain unchanged, only the notification
	engine has been enhanced.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>DNS resolution for multiple domains.</P
><P
>	The DNS naming system on the frontend now supports multiple zones,
	where each subnet managed by the frontend can be put into a different
	zone.
	The DNS service can be turned on or off for each individual zone.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Login appliance support.</P
><P
>	A node can be configured as a Login appliance.
	By default, a Login appliance can submit jobs, but it cannot execute
	jobs.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Set the name of a host based on the name of a specific
	network interface.</P
><P
>	The "primary_net" attribute allows nodes to have /bin/hostname set to
	the name of a network interface other than "private".
	This is useful for login or other multiple interface appliances.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Easily swap 2 interfaces with one Rocks command.</P
><P
>	To swap the settings of 2 interfaces, execute "rocks swap host
	interface ...".
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Created a GIT repository for Rocks-related source code.</P
><P
>	The host "git.rocksclusters.org" is a GIT repository for all core
	Rocks code, UCSD Triton Resource code and Rocks contrib code.

>B.5.2. Enhancements</A
></H2
><P
>OS: Based on CentOS release 5/update 5 and all updates as of
	November 2, 2010.</P
><P
>Base: Anaconda installer updated to v11.1.2.209.</P
><P
>Base : no longer remap the private network to "eth0", instead
	Rocks keeps track of the network a node kickstarted from and maps that
	network to the "private" network. For example, if a node kickstarted
	off "eth1", then "eth1" will be mapped to the private network.</P
><P
>Base : hardened the Anaconda installer to more aggressively write
	the grub configuration files onto the boot disk.
	This helps to mitigate the "hang while trying to load Grub stage2"
	issue.</P
><P
>Base : removed ext4 kernel module from installation environment.
	We found that trying to mount a swap partition as an ext4 file system
	frequently caused kernel panics during installations.</P
><P
>Base : added ksdevice=bootif to all the PXE boot targets.
	This improves installation speed by reusing the IP address/interface
	information when a node PXE boots.
	Previously, a node would re-scan all ethernet interfaces.</P
><P
>Base : when a node XML file has a syntax error,
	"rocks list host profile" prints out the name of the node XML file and
	the line number where the syntax error occurred.</P
><P
>Base : "rocks run host" now spawns multiple parallel threads when
	multiple hosts are supplied. Also added the following
	parameters: timeout (thanks Tim Carlson!), delay, stats, collate and
	num-threads.</P
><P
>Base : yum configuration default modified to bind to the
	frontend's public IP instead of the private.
	This facilitates easy package installation for external nodes (e.g.,
	nodes running on a public cloud).</P
><P
>Base : non-existent attributes are considered to be false
	conditionals when building configuration files.</P
><P
>Base : "precedes" method added for Rocks command plugins to
	enable fine-grained ordering of plugin execution.</P
><P
>Base : network interfaces under Linux support 2 new specific
	modes: "dhcp" and "noreport".
	The "dhcp" mode indicates that the interface should always DHCP to
	get its address.
	The "noreport" mode specifies that no "ifcfg-*" file should be
	written for the interface.
	If a mode is not specified for an interface, then Rocks will create
	an "ifcfg-*" file for the interface based on values set in the
	database (just like it did in the previous release).</P
><P
>Base : IPMI now uses the interface channel column in the
	networks table to specify the baseboard controller
	channel number.</P
><P
>Base : text inside "changelog" tags is now wrapped in CDATA to
	allow XML escape characters.
	This is only supported for node XML files found within Rolls (not
	for node XML files found under
	/export/rocks/install/site-profiles.</P
><P
>Base : rolls can be built without a complete copy of the Rocks
	source code.
	They use the Rocks development environment found under
	/opt/rocks/share/devel on a frontend.</P
><P
>Area51: tripwire updated to v2.4.2.</P
><P
>Bio: refreshed CPAN modules.</P
><P
>Bio: refreshed CPAN MPI-Blast.</P
><P
>Bio: added Celera Whole Genome Sequence Assembler.</P
><P
>Condor: updated to v7.4.4.</P
><P
>Condor: automated Condor configuration completely retooled:
	1) the configuration is Rocks command based instead of standalone
	CondorConf tool,
        2) it supports dynamic update of any/all configurations on nodes,
        3) it uses Rocks command plugins to allow additional automated condor
	config (e.g., via plugin, it can turn on MPI support).</P
><P
>Condor: supports a pool password (shared secret) for additional
	host verification.</P
><P
>Condor: integrates with EC2 roll to extend Condor pools with
	EC2 Hosts.</P
><P
>Condor: support added for port ranges to facilitate firewall
	configuration.</P
><P
>Condor: local copy of Condor's manpages added to roll
	documents.</P
><P
>Condor: support for updating Condor on nodes without
	re-installation (e.g., rocks run host "yum update condor" ; rocks sync
	host condor).</P
><P
>Ganglia: monitor-core updated to v3.1.7.</P
><P
>Ganglia: rrdtool updated to v1.4.4.</P
><P
>Ganglia: the Ganglia Roll can now be added on-the-fly to an
	existing frontend.</P
><P
>Ganglia: all nodes send out their metric metadata every 3
	minutes. In the past, when gmond was restarted on the frontend, it
	couldn't collect metrics from the nodes because it had no metadata
	from the nodes (and it didn't have a way to ask the nodes because the
	nodes are configured in "deaf" mode).</P
><P
>HPC: iozone updated to v3.347.</P
><P
>HPC: iperf updated to v2.0.5.</P
><P
>HPC: MPICH2 updated to v1.2.1p1.</P
><P
>HPC: OpenMPI updated to v1.4.3.</P
><P
>HPC: rocks-openmpi is the default MPI and it is configured with
	mpi-selector.</P
><P
>SGE: SGE updated to V62u5.</P
><P
>SGE: any host can be configured to be an execution host by
	setting the host's "exec_host" and "sge" attributes to true and any
	host can become a submission host by setting the host's "submit_host"
	and "sge" attributes to true.</P
><P
>Web-server: mediawiki updated to v1.16.0.</P
><P
>Web-server: wordpress updated to v3.0.1.</P
><P
>Xen: any node can how host Xen virtual machines. This is
	controlled with the "xen" attribute.</P
><P
>Xen: set the power for all nodes in a virtual cluster (except
	the VM frontend) with one command ("rocks set cluster power ...").
	Power settings can be "on", "off" or "install" (turn on and force
	installation).</P
><P
>Xen: allow virtual machines to define VLAN tagged interfaces.
	Previously, VLAN tagging was only supported for physical
	interfaces.</P

>B.5.3. Bug Fixes</A
></H2
><P
>Base: non-root users can no longer see the encrypted passwords
	with 'rocks list host attr'. Hashed passwords are now stored in
	a 'shadow' column in the attribute tables.</P
><P
>Base: the "%" in "rocks run host %" now returns all hosts.
	Thanks to Tom Rockwell for the fix.</P
><P
>Base: If an ethernet switch sends out a DHCP request, the DHCP
	server no longer sends it the "filename" and "next server" in the
	DHCP response.
	This caused some switches not to properly load their firmware. More
	generally, this is controlled by the "kickstartable", "dhcp_filename"
	and "dhcp_nextserver" attributes.</P
><P
>Base: "rocks set password" asks the user to confirm their new
	password.</P
><P
>Base: when a node requests a kickstart file and if the frontend
	determines that the frontend is too "busy", the kickstarting node now
	correctly does a random backoff before re-requesting its kickstart
	file. Prior to this fix, a node would backoff for 30 seconds.</P
><P
>Base: multiple conditionals can now be present in XML tags.</P
><P
>Base: fixed a graph traversal issue. In the past, if you had the
	graph "a" (cond) to "b" to "c" and if "cond" was false, the graph
	traversal would include "a" and "c". Now it just includes "a".</P
><P
>Base: permissions set in the "file" tag are preserved even if
	there are other "file" tags for the same file that don't set the file's
	permissions. The bug was when a later "file" tag without a "perms"
	attribute was encountered, the file's permissions were cleared.</P
><P
>Base: "file" tags now support "os" conditionals.</P
><P
>Base: in insert-ethers, appliances that are marked "not
	kickstartable" will not have to wait for a kickstart file. In the past,
	one had to hit the "F9" (force quit) key to exit insert-ethers when
	discovering non kickstartable appliances (e.g., ethernet switches).
	</P
><P
>Base: IPMI configuration cleaned up.
	Rocks no longer generates erroneous entries in modprobe.conf or
	/etc/sysconfig/ifcfg-ipmi.</P
><P
>Base: The "pre" tag now supports the "interpreter="
	attribute.</P
><P
>Bio: eliminated "Permission Denied" errors during multiple runs
	on the same BLAST database by different users.</P
><P
>SGE: made the job collection metric more efficient.
	Previously, when
	100's of jobs are submitted to a frontend's queue, the SGE metric
	would take so long to execute, it caused gmond to stop gathering
	metrics for all hosts.</P
><P
>SGE: the number of CPUs array jobs consume are now correctly
	counted.</P
