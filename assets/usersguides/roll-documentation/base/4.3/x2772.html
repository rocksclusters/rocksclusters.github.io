>This software was originally written by Jim Hugunin when he was at MIT, later
at CNRI.

Then Paul Dubois of LLNL became the "keeper". LLNL has released any
contributions to it by LLNL personnel for free redistribution.  However, many
people have contributed to Numpy.  It is a classic open source effort that
nobody "owns".  So, Numerical Python is placed in the SourceForge under the
Python license. The LLNL license is in Legal.htm.
