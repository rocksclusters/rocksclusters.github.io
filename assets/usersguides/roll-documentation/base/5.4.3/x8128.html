><P
>Rocks Security</P
><P
>  The root password supplied during the frontend
		installation is now used only for the root password of the
		frontend. Earlier, this password would be used for the MySQL
		database, Wordpress, and as root passwords for all compute
		nodes. All these services are now configured 
		randomly-generated passwords.
	</P
><P
> To set the root passwords for individual backend nodes, the user
	can now use command line tool 
	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>rocks add host sec_attr ... attr=root_pw</SAMP
> 
	to add a specific root password. 
	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>rocks sync host sec_attr ... </SAMP
> for
	the password to be set.  Root passwd on the frontend is changed using
	the OS-supplied <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>passwd</SAMP
> command.
	 </P
><P
>	The rationale behind setting random root passwords for all backend nodes
	is that, if by some means, an attacker gained access to the root
	account of a backend node, and then the adversary could ran an 
	offline attack against the crypted version of the root password, 
	none of the other nodes would be compromised.
	</P
><P
>We've introduced the concept of secure attributes in the
	database. Any attribute such as passwords, private keys, etc can be
	stored in the secure attributes table in the database. This table is
	locked down to be readable only by root, and no one else. It's contents
	are not transferred during kickstart, and can only be synced using
	<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>rocks sync host sec_attr</SAMP
>, 
	which will update the host specific secure
	attributes. Each attribute must also have a plugin associated with it,
	to specify the action to be performed on the backend nodes with the
	secure attribute as its data.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Changes to 411 infrastructure</P
><P
>	411 files can now only be requested by privileged accounts 
	on backend nodes.
	This is enforced by checking that 411 requests originate only
	from privileged ports. Iptables is used to filter out requests that
	come in from non-privileged ports.
	</P
><P
>	411 filters now support pre-send, filter, and post-receive functions.
	These functions are used to modify the contents of the 411 files being
	distributed, and to perform local system actions once the 411 files have
	been received and written to disk. These filters are present in the form
	of 411 plugins which are stored, modified, and enhanced on the frontend.
	</P
><P
>	The 411 shared key is now distributed outside the kickstart file. This is
	driven by the command line. The client makes an RPC request to the
	frontend, and the frontend transfers the 411 shared key out-of-band. It
	uses rocks command line tools to verify that the request is coming from
	within the cluster.
	</P

><P
>Introduction of the categories and indicies for
	resolving host specific properties in the database.</P
><P
>		With this release, we've laid the foundation for creating and
		using random categories of host groups.
	</P
><P
>		In the previous releases of rocks, the only categories available
		to system administrators by which they could group hosts were -
		Global category, Appliance category, OS category, and Hosts
		category.
	</P
><P
>		With this release, we've introduced the capability of being able
		to create user specified categories. Some examples are - rack
		category, where hosts are grouped by rack, a bio category -
		where hosts can be grouped by whether or not a set of hosts have
		the bio roll installed, etc.
	</P
><P
>		We've also introduced the concept of category resolution, where
		when resolving all the categories that a host can belong to, we
		can specify an chain of resolution. For example - we can state
		that compute-0-0 belongs to categories [global, linux, compute,
		rack0, bio]. In our resolution, we can state that we want the
		properties of the hosts to be picked up from [global, compute,
		rack0]. This way compute-0-0 picks up only the properties that
		are part of its resolution chain of categories.
	</P
><P
>	Since this feature is still prototypical, at the moment, it is used only
	internally for firewall commands and single resolution chain. Subsequent
	releases will apply the same technique to attributes and routes.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Changes to Firewall commands</P
><P
>		The rocks firewall commands now require the presence of a
		rulename for every iptables rule. These rules are then ordered
		lexicographically by rule name.
	</P
><P
>		The firewall command structure has some significant changes 
		to reflect
		the categories and indicies feature described in the previous
		bullet point. Please look at the rocks command line
		documentation for more details on how to run the rocks firewall
		commands.

><P
>Introduction of Perl and Python rolls</P
><P
>		Two new rolls have been added to Rocks.
	</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Perl Roll - 
		The Perl roll contains Perl 5.14.1, and plenty of CPAN modules
		that are required for the application software in Rocks to
		function properly. This version of Perl in installed in
		<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>/opt/perl</SAMP
>.
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Python Roll - The version of Python that the core rocks
		utils depend on, is version 2.4.2. This is a rather dated
		version of Python. To provide users with the latest versions of
		python, we've create a Python roll which contains Python version
		2.7.2 and version 3.2.1. These are both installed in
		<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>/opt/python/</SAMP
>.

>B.1.2. Enhancements and Bug Fixes</A
></H2
><P
>	Base: Updated anaconda to v11.1.2.224
	</P
><P
>	Base: Built against CentOS 5.6 with Updates as of August 7, 2011
	</P
><P
>	Base: database secured during installation. DB security now setup using
	script.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Only root can create tables in cluster db. Use the rocks.my.cnf
	file to connect to db as root, because the db is already secured by the
	time this xml file.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Default random root passwords for client nodes
	</P
><P
>	Base: Added a Development Appliance. This is a backend appliance 
	designed for building rolls without impacting the frontend. The 
	appliance uses the frontend yum repository by default but can be
	configured to use it own local repository for full isolation. 
	</P
><P
>	Base: Removed foundation-perl, cpan, and cpan-support. These have been
	moved to the Perl roll
	</P
><P
>	Base: Save the debug files from the ramdisk onto /root of the hard disk,
	so we can use them for post-install analysis.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Properly report disk partitions into the database for software
	RAID file systems. Increase installation speeds for clients with
	software RAID file systems.
	</P
><P
>	Base: 411 shared key is no longer transferred through kickstart.
	It is transferred through "rocks sync host sharedkey"
	411 configuration is now generated through "rocks report host config411"
	411 files are not transferred during kickstart. They are now transferred
	at first boot.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Unambiguous add host command. Previously it was not possible add
	hostnames that were command line actions. For example, you could not
	add a host called "attr" because the command "rocks add host attr" 
	exists. 
	</P
><P
>	Base: Remove shadow attributes from attributes tables and added secure
	attributes tables.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Set primary interface of login servers back to private. Otherwise
	SGE behaves badly.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Firewall rules now have rulenames and lexical ordering.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Add profile.d/ssh-keygen to login appliances
	</P
><P
>	Base: Hard link /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/id_rsa.pub to
	/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. If a user (or update) sets root's directory
	permissions tightly, we still read the public key.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Block non-priviledged traffic to 411 port from all networks,
	including localhost.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Add variable to manage number parallel instances of "rocks sync
	host" commands.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Support for pre-send, filtering, and post receive actions in 411.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Minor modification to 411put. Use a get_filename function instead
	of a filename constant.
	</P
><P
>	Base: 411 plugins can access host attributes
	</P
><P
>	Base: 411 filters user password, and shadow information of users with
	UID &#60; 500
	</P
><P
>	Base: Initial Support for host categories and indicies.
	</P
><P
>	Base: named.conf bug fixes - Now supports multiple subnets on non-octet
	boundaries.
	</P
><P
>	Base: If yum install fails due to dependency error, force install using
	rpm --nodeps.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Rocks run roll now honors the "--interpreter" flag to the
	post sections.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Honor .&#60;arch&#62; directive to yum install.
	When installing packages use,
	"yum install &#60;package&#62;" instead of "yum install
	&#60;packagefile&#62;.rpm"
	</P
><P
>	Base: Use YUM instead of RPM for rocks run roll
	This fixes two issues - On 64bit we were not installing the 32bit RPMs,
	and name.arch packages were not being installed.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Support for HVM when using the Xen roll.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Runtime optimization: Do not regenerate ALL pxeboot files. 
	Just those for the hosts
	specified on the command line.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Parallel class now takes care of serializing
	tasks that may overrun the system. If more than
	a set number of tasks are running, then requesting
	tasks will wait till slots are available to run
	Each task now prints out error messages if they fail
	on remote hosts. This way, we can track which syncs failed
	and which ones succeeded.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Root ssh key needs to be passwordless to allow command/sync access
	to backend nodes. If root, create ssh key without passphrase. If normal user, create
	key interactively.
	</P
><P
>	Base: Updated Java to 1.6 update 26
	</P
><P
>	Base: Support for versioned centrals
	</P
><P
>	HPC: Removed ganglia-web-frontend-addons from HPC roll

	</P
><P
>	Ganglia: Updated apr-utils to v1.3.13
	</P
><P
>	Java: Tomcat-connectors rpm bug fix. Now no longer generates conflicts
	when installing tomcat httpd configuration.
	</P
><P
>	SGE: Upgraded SGE to Open Grid Scheduler v6.2 update 5p2
	</P
><P
>	SGE: Move the login appliance configuration out of the SGE roll and into
	the Base roll.
	</P
><P
>	Web Server: Updated Wordpress to 3.1.3
	</P
><P
>	Web Server: Updated Rocks Theme for Wordpress.
	</P
><P
>	Web Server: Scrub root password from the installation and set the admin
	password to a string that never hashes.
	</P
><P
>	Web Server: Wordpress admin password can be reset only if valid admin
	email is supplied.
	</P
><P
>	Xen: Now support HVM as well as paravirtual instances
	</P
><P

><P
>	libvirt messages.
	Xen: touch /var/lock/subsys/xendomains in order to save running VMs
	</P
><P
>	Xen: Ability to put frontend on arbitrary vm-container and set its name
	</P
><P
