>B.7.1. Enhancements</A
></H2
><P
>OS: Based on CentOS release 5/update 4 and all updates as of
	December 15, 2009.</P
><P
>Area51: chkrootkit updated to v0.49.</P
><P
>Base: Anaconda installer updated to v11.1.2.195.</P
><P
>Base: Added support HP's Smart Array controllers
	(e.g., the 'cciss' driver) in the Rocks partitioning code.</P
><P
>Base: Moved JDK to the Base Roll (the Java Roll has been
	discontinued).</P
><P
>Base: Added the 'ssh_use_dns' attribute (default setting is
	'true'). If set to 'false', then DNS is not consulted when trying
	to make an SSH connection. This speeds up SSH connections for
	frontend's that don't have access to a functioning DNS server.
	</P
><P
>Base: Added the 'Kickstart_DefaultLeaseTime' and
	'Kickstart_MaxLeaseTime' attributes to give the user the ability to
	control their own DHCP lease timeouts.
	</P
><P
>Base: Added IMPI tools and configuration utilities.
	</P
><P
>Base: Updated foundation-perl to v5.10.1.</P
><P
>Base: Updated foundation-perl-Tk to v804.028.</P
><P
>Base: Experimental CPAN support. This introduces a utility that
	lets the user create Rocks RPMs directly from CPAN along with all
	dependencies.
	</P
><P
>Bio: Updated Emboss to v6.1.0.</P
><P
>Bio: Updated biopython to v1.52.</P
><P
>Bio: Updated clustalw to v2.0.12.</P
><P
>Bio: Updated fasta to v35.4.9.</P
><P

><P
>HPC: Updated iozone to v3.291.</P
><P
>HPC: Updated iperf to v2.0.4.</P
><P
>HPC: Updated MPICH2 to v1.1.1p1.</P
><P
>HPC: Updated OpenMPI to v1.3.3.</P
><P
>SGE: Updated to v6.2 update 4.</P

>B.7.2. Bug Fixes</A
></H2
><P
>Area51: tripwire is now correctly configured on the
	frontend.</P
><P
>Base: Increase the amount of memory PHP can use from 64 MB
	to 256 MB. This is essential for viewing Ganglia data for large
	clusters.</P
><P
>Base: During installation, don't copy over the rocks-cdrom
	block device file. On most systems, there is no issue, but there are
	some systems where this code would copy over the entire contents of
	the CD/DVD if the CD/DVD was still in the tray (which is shouldn't be,
	because after the rolls are copied to the frontend, the CD/DVD is
	umounted and ejected).
	</P
><P
>Base: Set the '--utc' flag when hwclock is called. Without the
	flag, the localtime is written to the hardware clock. Then, at first
	boot, the system reads the hardware clock respecting the UTC settings
	in /etc/sysconfig/clock. So the system time ends up being off by the
	offset to UTC.
	</P
><P
>Base: On first boot, Set the number of CPUs for the frontend in
	the database to actual number of detected CPUs. In the past, this
	value was hard-coded to 1.
	</P
><P
>Base: Fix for frontend's that use DNS servers that are configured
	to return a 'catch all' address for non-existant domain names. Do a
	reverse lookup to get the IP address. In the previous release, one
	would see an 'XXX' entry for the IP address of the frontend in
	/etc/hosts.
	</P
><P
>Base: Put double quotes around 'option domain-name', otherwise,
	if the domain name was structured like xxx.yyy, then the DHCP service
	would not start.
	</P
><P
>Base: For tentakel, throttle the number of concurrent
	connections to 100 (useful for large clusters).
	</P
><P
>Base: Rewrite the pxelinux.cfg files after setting the
	run/install action in the nodes table (e.g., 'rocks set host
	installaction ...').
	</P
><P
>Base: For 'rocks set password', make sure password changing
	code accesses the Rocks foundation database.
	</P
><P
>Base: For 'rocks sync host network', make sure to update the
	static routes file.
	</P
><P
>Base: Fixed 'insert-ethers --replace'. Before, it correctly
	removed the node, but then readded it at 'the end' of namespace,
	that is, it forgot the rack/rank of the replaced node.
	</P
><P
>Base: Make tentakel more resilient to hanging nodes.
	</P
><P
>Ganglia: Fix to save all RRD data on frontend shutdown.
	</P
><P
>Ganglia: Fixes to physical views. Make sure all nodes are
	positioned in rack/rank order.
	</P
><P
>Ganglia: Fixes to rediscover all backend nodes after a
	frontend reboot. Without this fix, if gmond was restarted on the
	frontend, then it requires restarting gmond on all the compute nodes
	in order to get metrics to report again.
	</P
><P
>Kernel: Fixes to preserve the timestamp from RPMs on Rolls
	that are installed via CD/DVD. Prior to this fix, all RPMS in Rolls
	that were installed from CD/DVD would have the timestamp of the
	time when the frontend was installed. This causes issues when trying
	to update RPMs after the frontend was installed.
	</P
><P
>SGE: When a host is removed (e.g., 'rocks remove host ...'),
	make sure the queue associated with that node is also removed.
	</P
><P
>SGE: Build the DRMAA library with Java support.
	</P
><P
>Xen: Respect the MTU value of the physical interface when
	bringing up Xen bridges.
	</P
><P
>Xen: Fix to enable physical devices (partitions, LVM
	partitions, etc.) to be used as devices for virtual disks.
	</P
><P
>Xen: Fix to 'ip' address flag in 'rocks add host vm'. Without
	the fix, if an IP address was specified on the command line, the
	command would throw an exception.
	</P
><P
>Xen: Fix to support for virtual compute nodes that are managed
	by a physical frontend.
