>Ganglia monitors</A
> running on each 
cluster node. The monitors gather values for various metrics such as CPU load, 
free memory, disk usage, network I/O, operating system version, etc. These 
metrics are sent through the private cluster network and are used by the 
frontend node to generate the historical graphs.</P
><P
>In addition to metric parameters, a heartbeat message from each node is 
collected by the Ganglia monitors.
When a number of heartbeats from any node are 
missed, this web page will declare it "dead". These dead nodes often have 
problems which require additional attention, and are marked with the 
Skull-and-Crossbones icon, or a red background.</P

><P
>This page is a version of the standard "top" command for your cluster. This page presents process information from each node in the cluster. This page is useful for monitoring the precise activity of your nodes.</P
><P
>The Cluster Top differs from standard top in several respects. Most importantly, each row has a "HOST" designation and a "TN" attribute that specifies its age. Since taking a process measurement itself requires resources, compute nodes report process data only once every 60 seconds on average. A process row with TN=30 means the host reported information about that process 30 seconds ago. </P
><P
>For brevity and minimal performance impact, each node only reports as many processes as it has CPUs. The processes shown had the highest %CPU utilization on the node at the time of reporting. Unfortunately the number of processes per node is not currently adjustable. The restriction lies in the structure of the Ganglia monitoring system, which only delivers information and has no faculty for accepting parameters on the fly. However, showing the most CPU intensive processes should give you a good idea of how the CPUs are being utilized.</P
><P
>The process data is gathered by raw processing of the /proc filesystem on each node. Memory statistics differ slightly from standard "ps" output, and are calculated from the /proc/[pid]/statm virtual file.</P
